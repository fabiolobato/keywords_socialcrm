0,"Highlights•This study aims to forecast the predictors of social CRM strategy adoption by SMEs.•SEM was used to determine which variables had important impact on social CRM adoption.•Neural network method was used to rank the importance level of predictors from SEM.•Compatibility and information capture are the most significant factors for social CRM adoption.The growth of social media usage questions the old-style idea of customer relationship management (CRM). Social CRM strategy is a novel version of CRM empowered by social media technology that offers a new way of managing relationships with customers effectively. This study aims to forecast the predictors of social CRM strategy adoption by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The proposed model used in this study derived its theoretical support from IT/IS, marketing, and CRM literature. In the proposed Technology-Organization-Environment-Process (TOEP) adoption model, several hypotheses are developed which examine the role of Technological factors, such as Cost of Adoption, Relative Advantages, Complexity, and Compatibility; Organizational factors, such as IT/IS knowledge of employee, and Top management support; Environmental factors such as Competitive Pressure, and Customer Pressure; and Process factors such as Information Capture, Information Use, and Information Sharing; all having a positive relationship with social CRM adoption. This research applied a following two staged SEM-neural network method combining both structural equation modelling (SEM) and neural network analyses. The proposed hypothetical model is examined by using SEM on the collected data of SMEs in Kuala Lumpur, the central city of Malaysia. The SEM approach with a neural network method can be used to investigate the complicated relations involved in the adoption of social CRM. The study finds that compatibility, information capture, IT/IS knowledge of employee, top management support, information sharing, competitive pressure, cost, relative advantage, and customer pressure are the most important factors influencing social CRM adoption. Remarkably, the results of neural network analysis show that compatibility and information capture of social CRM are the most significant factors which affect SMEs' adoption of this form of customer relationship management. The outcomes of this research benefit executives' decision-making by identifying and ranking factors that enable them to discover how they can advance the usage of social CRM in their firms. Furthermore, the findings of this study can help the managers/owners of SMEs assign their resources, according to the ranking of social CRM adoption factors, when they are making plans to adopt social CRM. This study differs from previous studies as it proposes an innovative new approach to determine what influences the adoption of social CRM. By proposing the TOEP adoption model, additional information process factors advance the traditional TOE adoption model.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2017.05.032,"['CRM adoption', 'Social CRM', 'Technology-organization-environment-process', 'SMEs', 'Social media', 'SEM-Neural network']",Computers in Human Behavior,Forecasting social CRM adoption in SMEs: A combined SEM-neural network method

In fact, while some authors have posited a relationship between BD and CRM, literature lacks works that go into the heart of the matter.Through an extensive up-to-date in-depth literature review about CRM, twenty (20) CSFs were singled out from 104 selected papers, and organized within an ad-hoc classification framework. The consistency of the classification was checked by means of a content analysis. Evidences were discussed and linked to the BD literature, and five propositions about how BD could affect CRM CSFs were formalized.Our results suggest that BD-enabled CRM initiatives could require several changes in the pertinent CSFs. In order to get rid of the hype effect surrounding BD, we suggest to adopt an explorative approach towards them by defining a mandatory business direction through sound business cases and pilot tests. From a general standpoint, BD could be framed as an enabling factor of well-known projects, like CRM initiatives, in order to reap the benefits from the new technologies by addressing the efforts through already acknowledged management paths.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2017.10.005,"['Big Data', 'CRM', 'Literature review', 'Critical Success Factors (CSFs)', 'Word tree']",Information Processing & Management,Big Data-enabled Customer Relationship Management: A holistic approach

Also, it is the strongest and the most efficient approach to maintaining and creating the relationships with customers. However, to the best of our knowledge and despite its importance, there is not any comprehensive and systematic study about reviewing and analyzing its important techniques. Therefore, in this paper, a comprehensive study and survey on the state of the art mechanisms in the scope of the CRM are done. It follows this goal by looking at five categories in which CRM plays a significant role: E-CRM, knowledge management, data mining, data quality and, social CRM. In each category, a couple of studies are presented and determinants of CRM are described and discussed. The major development in these five categories is reviewed and the new challenges are outlined. Also, a systematic literature review (SLR) in each of these five categories is provided.

Companies are finding it necessary to modify their approach to customer relationship management (CRM) and develop new marketing capabilities that facilitate customer satisfaction. The purpose of this study is to examine how social media usage can help firms build new CRM capabilities and thus improve marketing adoption strategies and business performance. We suggest that social CRM capability is critical when companies merge social media into their marketing strategies to improve customer engagement and firm performance.

However, the role that can be played by large amounts of available information in the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, when addressed by using emerging Big Data techniques for efficient client profiling, is still in its early stages. In this work, we addressed the client profile of the data in a CRM system of an international hotel chain, by using Big Data technology and Bootstrap resampling techniques for Proportion Tests. Strong consistency was found on the most representative feature of repeaters being traveling without children. Profiles were more similar for British and German clients, and their main differences with Spanish clients were in the stay duration and in age. For a vacation chain, these results suggest further analysis on the target orientation towards new market segments.

12,"The transition from a product-centric to a customer-centric business culture has been the subject of debate and research for more than a decade and in recent years many inquiries have been made about Customer Relationship Management. However, the main body of research around CRM was carried out in an environment quite different from the actual one. Apart from the possibilities and prospects that accompany new technologies and the new generation of Media, the big change stems from the strength gained by the contemporary Social Consumer which brings firms to operate within a Customer Ecosystem. Traditional CRM is morphing to Social CRM and the key concept in this new marketing and business environment is Customer Engagement. This is accompanied by the Involvement of the customer to a new type of relationship with the enterprise, characterized by co-creation of knowledge, offers, products and value. The present study attempts to estimate the degree to which the effectiveness of the so far (traditional) CRM practices, that are reflected on the customer-performance measures, affect the possibilities of Customer Engagement. The results show that the level of Customer Overall Satisfaction and Customer Affective Commitment to the bank, as well as the active Social Media Presence of the bank, should be considered as significant determinants of customer's willingness to get involved in a new type of relation with the bank.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.07.018,"['CRM', 'Engagement', 'Involvement Willingnes', 'Social CRM', 'Social Media (Web)', 'Web 2.0']",Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences,Customer Relationship Management in the Era of Social Web and Social Customer: An Investigation of Customer Engagement in the Greek Retail Banking Sector
13,"Customer relationship management (CRM) is a customer-centric business strategy which a company employs to improve customer experience and satisfaction by customizing products and services to customers' needs. This strategy, when implemented in totality eventually increases the revenue of the company. Traditionally, data mining (DM) techniques have been applied to solve various analytical CRM tasks. In turn, optimization techniques have long been used for training some of the DM techniques. However, during the past few years, evolutionary techniques have become so powerful and versatile that they can be deployed as a substitute for some DM techniques. This trend caught the attention of the researchers working in the analytical CRM area as they too started solving the CRM tasks using evolutionary techniques alone. In this context, we present a survey of evolutionary computing techniques applied to CRM tasks. In this paper, we surveyed 78 papers that were published during 1998 and 2015, where the application of evolutionary computing (EC) techniques to analytical CRM tasks is the main focus. The survey includes papers involving evolutionary computing techniques applied to the analytical CRM tasks under single- as well as multi-objective optimization framework. The purpose of the survey is to let the reader realize the versatility and power of EC techniques in solving analytical CRM tasks in the service industry and suggesting future directions.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2016.08.012,"['Customer relationship management', 'Data mining', 'Evolutionary computing', 'Optimization']",Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,Evolutionary computing applied to customer relationship management: A survey

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tools can now have access to relationship and interaction data of the customers, besides the traditional data sets such as billing information. While there has been a sharp increase in mining social and interaction data, integration of this information with the current data analytical models is limited. In this paper, we develop a new model for estimating the customer lifetime value in airline industry that integrates customers' social network and flight information. We first adopt a regression model for airline customers that can be used to estimate their CLVs. We then present a methodology to enhance this base model with customers' social network information to incorporate indirect contributions the customers make. We compare the performances of both models to show that our proposed method may improve the accuracy and reliability of models that make use of only flight related factors.

15,"The epistemological positioning of scientific approach involves the diversity of the viewpoints of academics and specialists, exclusiveness not being considered. This paper aims to reflect own contributions to the development of management theory and management practice in Romania. First of all, the proposed scientific approach is a positivist approach, because it envisages the interposition of own reflections, an observation of what is happening in the market, an authentic presentation as it is. The main objective of this scientific research is to highlight the importance of social media as a mean of business development by creating new opportunities through promotion and a better brand visibility in the market. In the literature we have outlined a number of methods to assess the way in which companies approach the CRM: call method, the interview, the questionnaire, etc. Quantitative investigation of this paper was conducted based on assessment questionnaire, addressed to the employees of some Romanian companies. The qualitative investigation was conducted at the end of the research, based on analysis and structuring the information obtained. In this paper there were analyzed three elements: management position with the implementation of a CRM system; CRM to SCRM transition and the use of the new SM technologies in the implementation of a CRM system; applying of a SCRM system using social media platforms. As a result of the conducted study it was found that the media is one of the main trainers of public opinion, if not the main, controlling the public sphere. It conveys information, but also it controls and steers the public opinion. Thus, SM can form quickly enough media crisis to lower the public favorability for certain companies or politicians. In this way, by resorting to specific Social Media tools, the companies can obtain crucial information for evaluating the consumer satisfaction, information that would be more difficult to obtain traditionally.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/S2212-5671(16)30270-2,"['customer relationship management', 'companies', 'economic performance']",Procedia Economics and Finance,Exploratory Study of the Companies’ Economic Performance Using a Social Customer Relationship Management

This paper on social CRM builds on a previous model of CRM prior to the growth of social media (Jayachandran et al., 2005). We present a new model for social CRM, including a new construct of customer engagement initiatives and adaptations of other constructs to cater for the impact of social media. An online survey was used to collect data from a population of marketing practitioners and partial least squares analysis was used to test the model. Findings show the importance of an underlying customer relationship orientation; how it impacts on social media technology use and customer engagement initiatives, and also directly on customer relationship performance. A relationship is also shown between engagement and relational information processes, which is viewed as a performance outcome of social CRM.

18,"In the early 2000s, several practitioners and authors have predicted the overshadowing of customer relationship management (CRM) systems by what is called enterprise resource planning systems II (ERP II). ERP II was envisioned to virtually cover all the processes within organizations from supply chain, CRM, to e-business. In 2000, Gartner group published an article titled “ERP is dead, long live ERP” in which they argued that in near future, ERP systems will overcome the need for other specialized systems (e.g. CRM). While there have been major advances in ERP systems since then, and the fact that most current ERP systems include CRM modules and applications, however, separate CRM systems are still widely adopted by organizations. Thus, this research attempts to investigate the main reasons that motivate organizations to invest in distinct CRM systems instead of using the CRM related modules in the acquired ERP system. Via a multiple case study, our results show that ERP II as envisioned, is not existent yet. Organizations tend to prefer separate CRM systems. Thus, we have developed four main reasons for this preference, which are: scoping during ERP implementations, costs, features, user-friendliness and ease of use.

Customer relationship management (CRM) is an important concept to maintain competitiveness at e-commerce. The issue of electronic customer relationship management (E-CRM) has increasingly become the identification of the success of the CRM implementation. The E-CRM has emerged as one of the most prominent information system that enables organizations to contact customers and collect, store and analyze customer data in order to provide a comprehensive view of their customers. Organization can obtain competitive advantages from increase effectiveness of the E-CRM. This research proposes determining the effective factors (cost, technology acceptance and employees' satisfaction) for the effectiveness of the E-CRM.

Such changes might inspire telecommunication service scenarios that user value relies on long-term performance. In this study, we propose a statistic-based approach to value latent users via time series segmenting time interval of RFM in large scale data set. Apart from utilizing in Spark platform, we integrate multiple corresponding analysis (MCA) to regularize clustering results by the RFM model and extend these approaches to multiple levels. A comprehensive set of experiments, revealed interesting observations regarding the co-existence of time interval and RFM model. First, the clustering method along time interval in three dimensions of the RFM model outperforms the method along the three dimensions in each interval.

Results suggest that emotional attachment to MSN and perceptions of its greater affordances for task accomplishment may lead to maladaptive behaviors of overreliance on MSN for job completion, blind trust, cognitive absorption and dysfunctional use. These associations increase in organizations with competitive psychological climate. Findings also show that using MSN for prospecting does not lead to maladaptive dependence, as opposed to using it for customer relationship maintenance. Salespeople using MSN for relationship maintenance exhibit more maladaptive behaviors if they experience work-related role stress. Finally, salespeople who exhibit MTDB are less likely to complete their assignments and participate in teamwork. These findings provide tools for organizations to develop technology use policies, design sales training, and enhance the work environment. Future studies can examine dependencies on others types of technologies (CRM, marketing automation, etc.), and in other contexts (online retailing, social media analytics, etc.)",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2017.12.025,"['Mobile social media', 'Professional sales', 'Maladaptive technology dependence', 'Technology addiction', 'Dark side of social networking']",Computers in Human Behavior,Mobile social networking and salesperson maladaptive dependence behaviors
24,"Highlights•Filling the gap between first adoption and final termination stage of social networking addiction.•Examing the underlying mechanism for rational use after excessive use of SNSs.•Pointing out technostress is an impetus for rational usage.Previous studies on excessive use of social networking services (SNSs) have relied on behavioral addiction theory to explain how users react when they face stress from overusing SNSs. Scholars have typically thought that users would stop using an SNS when they became addicted to the SNS and experienced stress from it. However, there seems to be a research gap between the initial adoption and the final intrusion stage of SNS usage. To fill that gap, our study uses a stimulus–organism–response paradigm to examine users' balancing mechanism for social network overuse. Based on a survey of users of social networking services in China, we found that (1) social interaction overload, invasion of work, and invasion of privacy had significant positive impact on technostress; (2) perceived usefulness of SNSs, perceived enjoyment of SNSs, and technostress had significant positive impact on rational usage; (3) social interaction overload had a negative impact on perceived performance, and invasion of privacy had a negative impact on performance and happiness. This paper contributes to the social networking overuse literature by highlighting the mechanism by which technostress elicits the rational use of SNSs.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2017.04.055,"['Social networking services', 'Technostress', 'Rational use', 'Stimulus–organism–response paradigm']",Computers in Human Behavior,The balancing mechanism of social networking overuse and rational usage
25,"The present study explored the association between the intensity of social media use for customer relationship management (CRM) and the business performance satisfaction of Thai microenterprises. The survey data were collected from 217 owners of the small shops at major marketplaces in Thailand. The results from partial least square regression analysis showed that the entrepreneurs who used social media intensively for CRM tended to report higher satisfaction with their business performance. Furthermore, the results from the moderating effect analyses found that the positive relationship between social media use intensity for CRM and business performance satisfaction tended to be significantly higher for the entrepreneurs who exhibited lower levels of social competency in business, as well as for the companies that generated more sales from social media. The main findings of this research provide practical implications for microenterprise entrepreneurs. Given that communication in social media tends to involve less interpersonal interactions than face-to-face communication, using social media for CRM activities might be essential in enabling entrepreneurs with low social competency to interact with customers to improve customer satisfaction. Also, this finding implies that using social media for CRM tends to be more crucial for companies that primarily target customers who are social media users.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmrv.2016.10.005,"['Customer relationship management', 'Social media marketing', 'Microenterprises', 'Social competency', 'Media naturalness theory']",Asia Pacific Management Review,Social media use for CRM and business performance satisfaction: The moderating roles of social skills and social media sales intensity
26,"Highlights•Effects of TOEM characteristics on SCRM adoption in start-ups is investigated.•Positive effects of T and E characteristics on SCRM adoption are shown.•Managerial characteristic did not have any positive impact on SCRM adoption.Despite their fairly recent emergence, start-up companies now play an important role in the economic development of countries around the globe. These companies have fewer tangible assets and capital, and therefore, the efficient delivery of services and products is a key business priority for them. Customer relationship management (CRM) technologies, which are designed to facilitate customer engagement during the design, development and delivery of services and products may play a significant role in the success or failure of start-up companies. Developments in new communication technologies have transformed traditional CRM into electronic CRM (eCRM), mobile CRM (mCRM); and more recently, social CRM (SCRM). However, there remains very little understanding of the factors affecting SCRM adoption in start-up businesses. The relative newness of SCRM technologies, coupled with the swiftly evolving nature of start-up companies: which has made them difficult cases to study – has limited the amount of research undertaken in this area. This paper aims to close this gap by proposing a framework that depicts the factors affecting start-up companies’ intention to adopt SCRM applications, and explores the relative importance of these factors. Inspired by an extended Technological, Organisational and Environmental (TOE) framework, this paper investigates effects of technological characteristics (TC), organisational characteristics (OC), environmental characteristics (EC) and managerial characteristics (MC) on start-up companies’ intentions to adopt SCRM applications.The results outlined in this research indicate that the observability, compatibility and trialability of SCRM solutions positively affect SCRM adoption in start-up businesses. Moreover, the availability of internal financial resources has a similarly positive effect. When considering environmental characteristics, it was found that support from venture capitalists, crowd funding support, governmental support, business angels support and external pressure all positively affect the intention to adopt SCRM applications within start-up businesses.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2016.12.004,"['Social customer relationship management', 'SCRM adoption', 'DOI', 'Start-up business']",Telematics and Informatics,Investigating the antecedents to the adoption of SCRM technologies by start-up companies

29,"Centrality and influence spread are two of the most studied concepts in social network analysis. In recent years, centrality measures have attracted the attention of many researchers, generating a large and varied number of new studies about social network analysis and its applications. However, as far as we know, traditional models of influence spread have not yet been exhaustively used to define centrality measures according to the influence criteria. Most of the considered work in this topic is based on the independent cascade model. In this paper we explore the possibilities of the linear threshold model for the definition of centrality measures to be used on weighted and labeled social networks. We propose a new centrality measure to rank the users of the network, the Linear Threshold Rank (LTR), and a centralization measure to determine to what extent the entire network has a centralized structure, the Linear Threshold Centralization (LTC). We appraise the viability of the approach through several case studies. We consider four different social networks to compare our new measures with two centrality measures based on relevance criteria and another centrality measure based on the independent cascade model. Our results show that our measures are useful for ranking actors and networks in a distinguishable way.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2017.10.029,"['Centrality', 'Linear threshold model', 'Independent cascade model', 'Spread of influence', 'Social network', '91D30', '05C22', '68R10']",Knowledge-Based Systems,Centrality measure in social networks based on linear threshold model
30,"Online Social Networks (OSNs) have been used as the means for a variety of applications. For example, social networking platform has been used in employment system, e-Commerce and CRM system to improve the quality of recommendations with the assistance of social networks. In these applications, social influence acts as a significant role, affecting people's decision-making. However, the existing social influence evaluation methods do not fully consider the social contexts, i.e., the social relationships and the social trust between participants, and the preferences of participants, which have significant impact on social influence evaluation in OSNs. Thus, these existing methods cannot deliver accurate social influence evaluation results. In our paper, we propose a Trust-Oriented Social Influence evaluation method, called TOSI, with taking the social contexts into account. We conduct experiments onto two real social network datasets, i.e., Epinions and DBLP.

32,"Firms that achieve to establish reciprocal and successful relationships with their clients can obtain greater profitability in their relationship marketing inversions. This study adopts the TOE model to consider technological factors (technological competence), organizational factors (innovativeness and employee support) and environment factors (customer information management) to define the perceived benefits deriving from mobile CRM. The empirical study was performed with information obtained from 125 firms and analyzed with structural equation modeling. Results suggest that the firm perceives benefits from the m-CRM use if it is technologically competitive, shows propensity to innovativeness, manages customers’ information and has employees’ support. The main contribution is the simultaneous use of the TOE model and the relationship marketing approach to understand, from the Spanish firm perspective, the perception of the management of the relationship with customers through the mobile phone.ResumenLas empresas que logran establecer relaciones recíprocas y exitosas con sus clientes pueden obtener mayor rentabilidad de sus inversiones en marketing relacional.

33,"Highlights•Social sustainability is transferred to virtual spaces through social networking sites.•We empirically assess the role of well-being as both a driver and an outcome of relationships and interactions.•Effects differ across age, gender, and extraversion categories.Although social sustainability involves processes that promote well-being, it is often neglected in the sustainability debate. Social networking sites (SNSs) such as Facebook are now pervasive venues for constant interpersonal communication and interaction, as well as general social connectedness. The debate between cyberoptimists and cyberpessimists about the implications of SNS use for well-being persists. The present study adopts a social sustainability perspective and seeks to further elucidate two competing hypotheses; thus, subjective well-being is included as a driver and an outcome of SNS use and social network characteristics. We conducted a survey of 678 Facebook users across various age categories and then applied a two-step approach to analyze the data. The results reveal that although the structural parameters seem to widely support the social enhancement hypothesis, a more differentiated analysis shows that highly extraverted individuals spend more time on Facebook when they are unhappy. Furthermore, the more time that such extraverts spend on Facebook, the more they believe that it improves their overall well-being. This finding is further supported by our identification of a four-class structure in which a clear distinction of users emerges based on age, gender, and extraversion.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2017.06.031,"['Social sustainability', 'Social networking sites', 'Facebook', 'Subjective well-being', 'Social enhancement hypothesis', 'Social compensation hypothesis']",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,The social side of sustainability: Well-being as a driver and an outcome of social relationships and interactions on social networking sites
34,"This paper proposes the implicit social networking as an innovative methodology for approaching consumers who possess information-rich user profiles based on aplethora of online services they use. An implicit social network is not explicitly built by consumers themselves, but implicitly calculated by third parties based on a level of a common interest between consumers (i.e., profile matchmaking). The analysis of aconsumer social network created in such a manner enables discovery of hidden roles, relationships and communities among consumers and represents a basis for provisioning of innovative services (e.g., personalized and/or context-aware services such as recommender systems). The implicit social networking methodology is evaluated through two pilot cases: (i) implicit social networking based on the SmartSocial platform; and (ii) implicit social networking of IPTV users. The generalizability of the implicit social networking is demonstrated through additional example aimed not at external company stakeholders (e.g., company consumers), but at internal stakeholders (i.e., company employees) through the implicit corporate social networking pilot case.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.185,"['user profiles', 'consumers', 'employees', 'matchmaking', 'social networking', 'social computing', 'social network analysis']",Procedia Computer Science,"Implicit Social Networking: Discovery of Hidden Relationships, Roles and Communities among Consumers"

Most managers perceive that social networks enhance business performance, but few measure the results. Firms that most frequently use social networks have managers with higher qualifications.

A complementary analysis (cluster analysis) identified three behavioral patterns with varying involvement with social networks. These patterns relate with types of use, suggesting a level of social media involvement/performance. Enhancing performance is likely related to knowledge-oriented social networks.

However, the success of SNS initiatives is largely dependent on sustainable user participation. In this study, we argue that the continuance intentions of users may be gender-sensitive. To theorize and investigate gender differences in the determinants of continuance intentions, this study draws on the expectation-confirmation model, the uses and gratification theory, as well as the self-construal theory and its extensions. Our survey of 488 users shows that while both men and women are motivated by the ability to self-enhance, there are some gender differences. Specifically, while women are mainly driven by relational uses, such as maintaining close ties and getting access to social information on close and distant networks, men base their continuance intentions on their ability to gain information of a general nature. Our research makes several contributions to the discourse in strategic information systems literature concerning the use of social media by individuals and organizations. Theoretically, it expands the understanding of the phenomenon of continuance intentions and specifically the role of the gender differences in its determinants. On a practical level, it delivers insights for SNS providers and marketers into how satisfaction and continuance intentions of male and female SNS users can be differentially promoted. Furthermore, as organizations increasingly rely on corporate social networks to foster collaboration and innovation, our insights deliver initial recommendations on how organizational social media initiatives can be supported with regard to gender-based differences.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsis.2017.01.004,"['Gender', 'Social networking sites', 'Facebook', 'Continuance intention', 'Satisfaction', 'Uses and gratifications', 'Gendered self-construal', 'Relational interdependence', 'Collective interdependence']",The Journal of Strategic Information Systems,Why men and women continue to use social networking sites: The role of gender differences
37,A large number of Social Media Management Systems (SMMS) have been developed to maintain multiple accounts over different online social networks. Each system has pros and cons and can be more or less useful depending on its features and cost. This paper presents a state of the art of the existing platforms for managing online social networks. The state of the art is structured with a framework that guides the analysis of each social media management system according to its own characteristics and the characteristics of the online social media content that the system helps to manage.

In this context, it is important to be able to identify and characterize users who contribute and communicate their knowledge in the network and help others to get their work done. In this paper, we propose a new methodological approach consisting of three steps, namely “message classification”, “identification of users’ roles” as well as “characterization of users’ roles”. We apply the approach to a dataset from a multinational consulting company, which allows us to identify three user roles based on their knowledge contribution in messages: givers, takers, and matchers. Going beyond this categorization, our data shows that whereas the majority of messages aims to share knowledge, matchers, that means people that give and take, are a central element of the network. In conclusion, the development and application of a new methodological approach allows us to contribute to a more refined understanding of users’ knowledge exchanging behavior in Enterprise Social Networks which can ultimately help companies to take measures to improve their knowledge management.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2018.02.012,"['Enterprise Social Networks', 'User roles', 'Knowledge contribution', 'Knowledge sharing', 'Knowledge seeking']",Computer Networks,“Thanks for sharing”—Identifying users’ roles based on knowledge contribution in Enterprise Social Networks

Establishing trust among those indirectly connected users performs a crucial role in improving the quality of social network services and creating the security for them. Nowadays, there are many paths between clients (service requesters) and target users (service providers) in online social networks. Among existing paths finding a trust path for trustworthy services is a vital job. Also, in many previous methods, such as ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) load balancing among target users is inefficient. Therefore, in this paper we propose an inverted ant colony optimization algorithm to find a reliable path along with improving load balancing among the target users. The inverted ant colony optimization algorithm is a diversity of the basic ant colony optimization algorithm in which, the updated pheromone has a reverse effect on the selected path by the ants.

45,"Highlights•A Shapley value method for finding top influencers in a customer network is proposed.•Using referral behaviour data improves the selection of top influencers.•Simulation-based influence spread overestimates actual influence spread.•Considering the influence of two-hop neighbours improves the influencer selection.Individuals influence each other through social interactions and marketers aim to leverage this interpersonal influence to attract new customers. It still remains a challenge to identify those customers in a social network that have the most influence on their social connections. A common approach to the influence maximization problem is to simulate influence cascades through the network based on the existence of links in the network using diffusion models. Our study contributes to the literature by evaluating these principles using real-life referral behaviour data. A new ranking metric, called Referral Rank, is introduced that builds on the game theoretic concept of the Shapley value for assigning each individual in the network a value that reflects the likelihood of referring new customers. We also explore whether these methods can be further improved by looking beyond the one-hop neighbourhood of the influencers. Experiments on a large telecommunication data set and referral data set demonstrate that using traditional simulation based methods to identify influencers in a social network can lead to suboptimal decisions as the results overestimate actual referral cascades. We also find that looking at the influence of the two-hop neighbours of the customers improves the influence spread and product adoption. Our findings suggest that companies can take two actions to improve their decision support system for identifying influential customers: (1) improve the data by incorporating data that reflects the actual referral behaviour of the customers or (2) extend the method by looking at the influence of the connections in the two-hop neighbourhood of the customers.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2016.07.005,"['Influence maximization', 'Social network', 'Customer referral', 'Shapley value']",Decision Support Systems,Identifying influencers in a social network: The value of real referral data

In this paper, we show how data from the social network site Facebook can be operationalized to gain insight into the individuals connected to a company's Facebook site. In particular, we propose a data collection framework to obtain individual specific data and propose methodology to explore user profiles and identify segments based on these profiles. The proposed data collection framework can be used as an identification step in an analytical customer relationship management implementation that specifically focuses on potential customers. We illustrate our methodology by applying it to the Facebook page of an internationally well-known professional football (soccer) club. In our analysis, we identify four clusters of users that differ with respect to their indicated “liking” profiles.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2014.12.001,"['Online profiling', 'Social networks', 'Customer relationship management', 'Correspondence analysis', 'Cluster analysis', 'Facebook']",Decision Support Systems,Online profiling and clustering of Facebook users

The ACG industry is not an industry of a single country or region but a global industry. In addition to its own revenue, the derivative products (or licensed merchandise) of ACG can extend the ACG industry to win more business opportunities. The ACG industry is mainly marketed towards younger people, who are the major users of social network sites. Hence, the electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) on social network sites often becomes a reference basis of the young people’s attitudinal acceptance and purchase intention in purchasing ACG-related derivative product.In this paper, we analyze the influential factors of positive eWOM’s communication motivations that affect consumer acceptance on social network sites, and apply the uncomplicated decision tree data mining algorithm to compute the association rules between these influential factors and consumer acceptance, expecting to understand the relationship between eWOM on social network sites and consumer acceptance. The results of this study can help the business decision-making in CRM and marketing of the industry of ACG-related derivative product. This study found that the degree of perception of ACG product and the degree of taking pleasure in sharing ACG-related information with others have a significant correlation with consumer acceptance.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2016.12.010,"['Animation', 'Comics and games', 'Consumer acceptance', 'Data mining', 'Decision tree', 'Word-of-mouth', 'Pokémon GO']",Telematics and Informatics,"Mining association rules between positive word-of-mouth on social network sites and consumer acceptance: A study for derivative product of animations, comics, and games"

Therefore, assessing and managing online complain influence has become a new problem for enterprise to listen to and manage online group complaints. This paper analyzed the complaint information feature of consumer group on online social network, from three-dimensional perspective of complaint text’s quality, transmission timeliness and user interaction degree. We built the influence measure model of online complaint theme based on entropy weight model by monitoring and analyzing real-time the static and dynamic properties of complaint information, explored the measure method of complaint theme influence, employed empirical method to verify the validity and provided scientific decision-making tools and methods for enterprise listening to and managing online group complains.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2014.03.018,"['Online social network', 'Complaint theme', 'Entropy model', 'Influence measure']",Expert Systems with Applications,Research on the measure method of complaint theme influence on online social network
49,"Highlights•The study explores consumer behavior for resonance marketing.•Uses and gratifications needs on SNSs are identified.•The mediating role of consume resonance is identified.•The association between consumer resonance and purchase intention is examined.•The findings provide insights into social participants' future purchase intentions.Consumer resonance is powerful in affecting a user's image of products and, as this resonance expands with iterative enforcement, the user's buying intention can be strongly altered. In order to develop consumer resonance, product messages articulated on a social network site (SNS) must be designed with the proper content and delivered through the proper channels. Using uses and gratifications theory, this study built a model to explain user behavior of consumer resonance on SNSs in dimensions of content gratification, social-relation gratification, and self-presentation gratification to drive increased purchase intention. By presenting two selected product articulates on social websites, we collected 392 samples and used modeling with partial least square to analyze the usable data. Meanwhile, a two-step cluster analysis method was applied to partition the sample into two groups and develop managerial implications by comparing them. The study results show that utilitarian value, tie strength, normative influence, information influence, and self-presentation have significant effects on customer resonance, which in turn influences purchase intention for successful consumer-brand relationship. It is hoped that the research findings might enhance our understanding of user resonance behavior and provide insights into social participants' future purchase intentions.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2016.12.014,"['Social networks', 'Customer behaviors', 'Uses and gratifications theory', 'Consumer resonance', 'Purchase intention']",Computers in Human Behavior,Generating consumer resonance for purchase intention on social network sites

Businesses need to understand Facebook and its benefits in achieving effective advertising campaigns. Further investigation is still needed to understand how effective social media and particularly, Facebook are for advertising. This study aimed to understand if there is a relationship between Facebook advertising effectiveness and benefits gained from such advertising. Statistical reasoning was used to measure the extent of two advertising benefits and their correlation in creating effective advertising campaigns on Facebook. Pearson’s bivariate correlation and linear regression analysis were implemented on data obtained from carrying out a survey on undergraduate students. The benefits of “customer relationship management” and “promoting new products” were tested in relation to Facebook advertising effectiveness. The results supported that Facebook is seen as an effective medium for advertising and it has a strong association with the described benefits of “customer relationship management” and “promoting new products”.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2017.11.220,"['Customer relationship management', 'effective advertising on Facebook', 'promoting new products']",Procedia Computer Science,Using statistical reasoning techniques to describe the relationship between Facebook advertising effectiveness and benefits gained

However, previous studies related to the usage and estimation of tie strength either assume that this parameter is given or use a computational model of their own. The amount, variety and domain specific information required to apply these models makes the reproducing and reusing of existing results extremely costly or utterly impossible. In our research, we show empirically the relative importance of different social variables for the computation of the tie strength and propose a computational model independent of the Social Networks’ domain.

We benchmark the performance of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Stochastic Adaptive Boosting, Kernel Factory, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines using five times twofold cross-validation. The results indicate that it is feasible to create models with high predictive performance. The top performing algorithm was Stochastic Adaptive Boosting with a cross-validated AUC of 0.66 and accuracy of 0.74. The most important predictors include deviation from regular usage patterns, frequencies of likes of specific categories and group memberships, average photo album privacy settings, and recency of comments.

In particular, we develop a theoretical model by blending cutting-edge research in consumers’ trust, value co-creation, and eWOM to study how these factors interact with each other through a systematic review. From the theoretical analysis, we note that eWOM has a direct impact on purchase intention, and has an indirect impact on purchase intention which is moderated by consumers’ trust on the underlying product. eWOM also has an impact on value co-creation, and value co-creation has an effect on purchase intention. Consumers’ trust on a product has an impact on value co-creation, and the message source in the SNSs moderates the impacts of eWOM on consumers’ trust on a product, value co-creation, and purchase intention. This study provides a theoretical ground for future empirical research into issues related to the inter-relationship between value co-creation and eWOM within the SNS context.

61,"Highlights•An evaluation framework to systematically measure the characteristics of the influence.•A dynamic information propagation model to predict the influence dynamics of social network users.•A comprehensive empirical study on a large-scale twitter dataset to compare the influence metrics.Identifying influential users and predicting their “network impact” on social networks have attracted tremendous interest from both academia and industry. Various definitions of “influence” and many methods for calculating influence scores have been provided for different empirical purposes and they often lack the in-depth analysis of the “characteristics” of the output influence. In addition, most of the developed algorithms and tools are mainly dependent on the static network structure instead of the dynamic diffusion process over the network, and are thus essentially based on descriptive models instead of predictive models. Consequently, very few existing works consider the dynamic propagation of influence in continuous time due to infinite steps for simulation. In this paper, we provide an evaluation framework to systematically measure the “characteristics” of the influence from the following three dimensions: (i) Monomorphism vs. Polymorphism; (ii) High Latency vs. Low Latency; and (iii) Information Inventor vs. Information Spreader. We propose a dynamic information propagation model based on Continuous-Time Markov Process to predict the influence dynamics of social network users, where the nodes in the propagation sequences are the users, and the edges connect users who refer to the same topic contiguously on time. Finally we present a comprehensive empirical study on a large-scale twitter dataset to compare the influence metrics within our proposed evaluation framework. Experimental results validate our ideas and demonstrate the prediction performance of our proposed algorithms.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2014.02.038,"['Social media', 'Influential users', 'Dynamic information diffusion', 'Continuous-Time Markov Process']",Expert Systems with Applications,Social network user influence sense-making and dynamics prediction

By analyzing data that was gathered through a survey, we show that knowledge of a person's social network can be helpful to predict that person's e-commerce acceptance for different products. Our experimental setup is interesting for companies because (1) knowledge about only a small number of connections of potential customers is needed, (2) knowing the intensity of the relation is not necessary, and (3) data concerning variables such as age, gender and whether one likes working with the PC is not needed. Hence, companies can rely on publicly available data on their customers' social ties.

63,"Highlights•The TTF model has its limitation in explaining social networking site (SNS) usage.•We propose a social/task-technology model to explain the intention to use SNS.•Social characteristics play a dominant role in evaluating the impact on SNS usage.•When users consider SNS is useful, they perceived SNS is fit for their social needs.Social networking sites (SNS) are one of the recent popular social media platforms. Successful SNS can attract millions of users in a few years, which has drawn much attention in the study of SNS. Understanding the relationships between a user’s intention and the utilization of SNS is an essential step in engaging the SNS as a marketing or educational tool. However, current research models for technology acceptance can hardly explain the impact on the intention of using SNS from the perspective of technology fit due to the lack of social constructs. This study examines and compares the impact of task, social, and technology characteristics on users’ intentions in using SNS by integrating the task-technology fit model and social capital theory. Data of 315 Facebook users were collected from the online questionnaire, and processed using the SmartPLS version 2.0 for path analysis and hypotheses tests. The results reveal that the social-technology fit has a dominant impact over the tasktechnology fit on users’ intentions to employ SNS. For SNS research, it suggests a reconceptualization of the current task-technology fit model by adding social constructs if necessary.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2013.10.020,"['Social networking sites', 'Task-technology fit', 'Technology acceptance', 'Social capital theory', 'Partial least squares']",Computers in Human Behavior,Toward an understanding of the behavioral intention to use a social networking site: An extension of task-technology fit to social-technology fit

A scenario-based 2 × 2 × 2 between-subjects experimental design was used. Results revealed that status-seeking individuals exhibited the high level of prosocial behavior when their behavior was recognized by others publicly compared to non status-seeking individuals.

71,"In this paper, we examine the impact of Twitter content on users’ train journeys and how train providers’ message framing moderates these relationships. Framing regards the way in which messages are worded concerning a particular object. In many consumer markets such as train journeys, firms frame messages in both positive and negative lights to persuade individuals to make purchase decisions (take intended journeys). We thus go beyond the literature’s current focus on consumer-generated content (CGC), and bring into contention the important role that marketer-generated content (MGC) plays in shaping the social media-based consumer relationship management (CRM) strategies. Specifically, we analyze commuter tweets about 14 train operators, along with the companies’ Twitter feeds. The findings, obtained using sentiment analysis tools, suggest that consumer sentiments only moderately impact travel performance, as measured by operator ratings, CPM (consumer performance measure; a measure based on travel incidents) and firm financial performance. On the other hand, it appears that train operators use tweets in relation to their services particularly well, while keeping customers engaged by listening to and learning from criticism, thus confirming the moderating role of their Twitter-based message framing strategies.

72,"Highlights•Literature has paid little attention to new sources of social media innovation.•Analyzing social media startups helps drawing the field’s innovation paths.•Social media startups are more focused on pure social network services.•Social media management is emerging as key area for social media startups.•Social media startups often develop open innovation relations with incumbents.As social media attract increasing attention from executives and find varied applications in different industries, research on the subject has been investigating the antecedents, moderators, mediators and outcomes of social media adoption, as well as impacts on the organizational and individual level. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the discussion of the new sources of social media innovation—i.e., the upstream originators of social media solutions. Such innovations of a possibly disruptive nature often originate from startups, which can constitute a significant driver for social media development and can influence the adopting incumbents’ behaviors. This study aims at shedding first light on social media-based solutions developed and delivered by startups. By surveying the Crunchbase database, we identified 724 funded social media startups, which were further classified into six categories, namely: (i) social network; (ii) social commerce; (iii) social recruitment; (iv) social management; (v) social loyalty and advocacy; (vi) contact management. Our findings show how the large majority of startups deliver social network solutions to incumbents, followed by social media management applications.

This study examines whether social network traits (tie strength and centrality) of Chinese consumers influence the adoption of arguments about Korean cultural products in the social media context. Further, an experimental study confirms that argument presentation (text versus image) and the consumer’s involvement level affect the adoption. Finally, the adoption of arguments on Korean cultural products is found to influence Chinese consumers’ intention to purchase products made in Korea, suggesting the presence of the country-of-cultural-origin effect.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.elerap.2017.12.005,"['Argument adoption', 'Consumer involvement', 'Cultural products', 'Social media', 'Social network', 'Purchase intention']",Electronic Commerce Research and Applications,"Social media, information presentation, consumer involvement, and cross-border adoption of pop culture products"

As, social media research in the field of industrial marketing has been of increasing interest, this research attempts to review and assess the advances in social media research in the industrial marketing field. From the literature review conducted, it can be identified that some of the research areas have witnessed steady theory development increases, e.g., sales and marketing communications, while others are clearly lagging behind, e.g., pricing and ethics. Also methodological pluralism is called for instead of more traditional methods (conceptual analysis, qualitative and survey) to establish and solve more nuanced research problems.

75,"The Semantic Brand Score (SBS) is a new measure of brand importance calculated on text data, combining methods of social network and semantic analysis. This metric is flexible as it can be used in different contexts and across products, markets and languages. It is applicable not only to brands, but also to multiple sets of words. The SBS, described together with its three dimensions of brand prevalence, diversity and connectivity, represents a contribution to the research on brand equity and on word co-occurrence networks. It can be used to support decision-making processes within companies; for example, it can be applied to forecast a company's stock price or to assess brand importance with respect to competitors. On the one side, the SBS relates to familiar constructs of brand equity, on the other, it offers new perspectives for effective strategic management of brands in the era of big data.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.03.026,"['Brand importance', 'Brand equity', 'Brand management', 'Social network analysis', 'Semantic analysis', 'Words co-occurrence network']",Journal of Business Research,The Semantic Brand Score

Some reports seek to counteract deterioration or disorder in urban neighborhoods (e.g., potholes), suggesting that they might be motivated by territoriality. We examined this question through a survey of CRM users in Boston, MA, which was combined with their patterns of reporting, as derived from the CRM database (N = 660). The survey included measures of three territorial motives and social and personal relationships with the neighborhood. We test a three-layer model in which neighborhood relationships predict territorial motives, and both predict reporting patterns. The findings suggest that the greatest motive for such reports is to benefit the community. Other results regarding the role of social cohesion and local social networks are also discussed.

Despite the recent popularity of exponential-family of random graph models (ERGMs) in various scientific investigations, no studies have utilized these inferential methods of network analysis in hospitality and tourism studies. In some contexts, the power of these methods is undeniably superior to those of conventional statistical tests. Accordingly, in the current study, by using the controversial subject of tourism-peace, I demonstrated how ERGMs can be used in hypotheses testing and statistical modeling in hospitality and tourism context.

Building on studies that use the work boundary to define formal and informal social interactions, this research aims to illuminate how informal buyer-supplier employee interactions influence buyer firms' innovation capabilities through knowledge acquisition. Integrating the literatures on absorptive capacity and social interaction, the analysis of survey data from 273 Chinese manufacturing firms suggests that employees' informal interactions are positively associated with knowledge acquisition and enhance firms' innovation capabilities.

The literature review debates how the use of social media empowers people to engage in conversational and collaborative KM, which in turn enriches people's cognitive and creative processes. Data collected from Greek tourism professionals confirmed that employees’ creativity is positively related to their participation in social networks and their use of social media for: searching, storing and reading information (internal cognitive processes); and sharing, discussing and co-creating information (external cognitive processes). The study contributes to the field by providing a theoretical underpinning and practical evidence showing how social networks (i.e. a meso level) can influence employees’ creativity. Hence, the findings highlight the need to shift focus from identifying and managing creative individuals (micro level) and/or organisational contexts (macro level) to creating and managing creative social networks (meso level).",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2014.11.003,"['Knowledge management', 'Social networks', 'Social media', 'Creativity', 'Greece', 'Tourism', 'Hospitality']",International Journal of Hospitality Management,"Knowledge management, social media and employee creativity"

83,"Highlights•A novel approach combining ego-centric social network analysis, structural holes theory and survival analysis is used to predict software revision outcome.•A total of 32,962 revisions, 20,399 distinctive software project repositories, and a social network of 234,322 users were collected to validate the result.•Positional advantage in social network has been found to be associated with faster revision acceptance.Many software repositories are hosted publicly online via social platforms. Online users contribute to the software projects not only by providing feedback and suggestions, but also by submitting revisions to improve the software quality. This study takes a close look at revisions and examines the impact of social media networks on the revision outcome. A novel approach with a mix of different research methods (e.g., ego-centric social network analysis, structural holes theory and survival analysis) is used to build a comprehensible model to predict the revision outcome. The predictive performance is validated using real life datasets obtained from GitHub, the social coding website, which contains 32,962 pull requests to submit revisions, 20,399 distinctive software project repositories, and a social network of 234,322 users. Good predictive performance has been achieved with an average AUC of 0.84. The results suggest that a repository host's position in the ego network plays an important role in determining the duration before a revision is accepted. Specifically, hosts that are positioned in between densely connected social groups are likely to respond more quickly to accept the revisions. The study demonstrates that online social networks are vital to software development and advances the understanding of collaboration in software development research. The proposed method can be applied to support decision making in software development to forecast revision duration. The result also has several implications for managing project collaboration using social media.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2016.08.024,"['Software development', 'Social network analysis', 'Structural holes theory', 'Survival analysis', 'Predictive modeling']",Computer Networks,Predicting software revision outcomes on GitHub using structural holes theory

Taking the resource-based view of firms’ information capability, we consider firms’ social media initiatives as strategic resources for operational improvement. We posit that firms’ social media initiatives enhance dynamic knowledge-sharing routines through an information-rich social network, leading to both operational efficiency and innovativeness. Collecting secondary data in a longitudinal setting from multiple sources, we construct dynamic panel data (DPD) models. Based on system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation, we show that firms’ social media initiatives improve operational efficiency and innovativeness.

After moving toward cognitive science and corporate strategies in the early 2000s, marketing research returned to its traditional domains of consumer psychologies and customer management. While conscientious consumers are gradually restraining themselves from selfish indulgence, marketers have refocused on a new set of values that encompass mental, experiential, and societal well-being. In this regard, we adopt an unprecedented approach by incorporating topic modeling with social network analysis. The results show that, in terms of topic heterogeneity, the most impactful journals are the most diverse, whereas each runner-up has a unique focus. Among the journals, we detect two major co-authorship communities, and among the topics, we detect three. Further, we find that the communities of the most cited papers are composed of heterogeneous clusters of similar topics.

88,"Highlights•Capacity remuneration mechanisms are ubiquitous in real-world electricity markets.•Theory claims that energy-only markets can provide optimal capacity on their own.•However theory fails to account for two types of market failures.•Involuntary demand curbs under VOLL-pricing create security-of-supply externalities.•With inelastic demand, discretely sized capacity options lead to underinvestment.Economics so far provides little conceptual guidance on capacity remuneration mechanisms (CRM) in deregulated electricity markets. Ubiquitous in real-world electricity markets, CRMs are introduced country by country in an ad hoc manner, lacking the theoretical legitimacy and the conceptual coherence enabling comparability and coordination. They are eyed with suspicion by a profession wedded to a theoretical benchmark model that argues that competitive energy-only markets with VOLL pricing provide adequate levels of capacity. While the benchmark model is a consistent starting point for discussions about electricity market design, it ignores the two market failures that make CRMs the practically appropriate and theoretically justified policy response to capacity issues. First, energy-only markets fail to internalize security-of-supply externalities as involuntary curbs on demand under scarcity pricing generate social costs beyond the private non-consumption of electricity. Second, when demand is inelastic and the potential capacity additions are discretely sized, investors face asymmetric incentives and will underinvest at the margin rather than overinvest. After presenting the key features of the theoretical benchmark model, this paper conceptualizes security of supply externalities and asymmetric investment incentives and concludes with some consideration regarding design of CRMs.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2016.10.008,"['Electricity markets', 'Capacity remuneration mechanisms', 'VOLL pricing', 'Investment', 'Security of supply externalities', 'Asymmetric investment incentives']",Energy Policy,Rationales for capacity remuneration mechanisms: Security of supply externalities and asymmetric investment incentives

91,"Highlights•We improved churn prediction by analyzing a large social network.•The applied community detection showed a faster propagation time.•Simulation verifies better performance of the proposed method.Customer retention in telecommunication companies is one of the most important issues in customer relationship management, and customer churn prediction is a major instrument in customer retention. Churn prediction aims at identifying potential churning customers. Traditional approaches for determining potential churning customers are based only on customer personal information without considering the relationship among customers. However, the subscribers of telecommunication companies are connected with other customers, and network properties among people may affect the churn. For this reason, we proposed a new procedure of the churn prediction by examining the communication patterns among subscribers and considering a propagation process in a network based on call detail records which transfers churning information from churners to non-churners. A fast and effective propagation process is possible through community detection and through setting the initial energy of churners (the amount of information transferred) differently in churn date or centrality. The proposed procedure was evaluated based on the performance of the prediction model trained with a social network feature and traditional personal features.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2014.05.014,"['Churn prediction', 'Network analysis', 'Community detection', 'Diffusion process']",Expert Systems with Applications,Improved churn prediction in telecommunication industry by analyzing a large network
92,"Today, the use of social networks is growing ceaselessly and rapidly. More alarming is the fact that these networks have become a substantial pool for unstructured data that belong to a host of domains, including business, governments and health. The increasing reliance on social networks calls for data mining techniques that is likely to facilitate reforming the unstructured data and place them within a systematic pattern. The goal of the present survey is to analyze the data mining techniques that were utilized by social media networks between 2003 and 2015. Espousing criterion-based research strategies, 66 articles were identified to constitute the source of the present paper. After a careful review of these articles, we found that 19 data mining techniques have been used with social media data to address 9 different research objectives in 6 different industrial and services domains. However, the data mining applications in the social media are still raw and require more effort by academia and industry to adequately perform the job.

To better understand the socio-technical system we model alternative single pilot operations using Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) and analyse those models using Social Network Analysis (SNA). Four potential models of single pilot operations were compared to existing two pilot operations. Using SOCA-CAT from CWA, we were able to identify the potential functional loading and interactions between networks of agents. The interactions formed the basis on the SNA. These analyses potentially form the basis for distributed system architecture for the operation of a future aircraft.

96,"Highlights•B2B marketing research has widely emphasized the importance of customer references.•Yet, little is known about the effective use of customer references in B2B markets.•We conceptualize and develop measures for customer reference marketing (CRFM).•CRFM comprises of firm internal and external leveraging of customer references.•We demonstrate that CRFM has a positive relationship to firms' selling performance.The use of customer references to facilitate marketing and sales in business markets has received growing interest among practitioners and academics. The importance of references has been highlighted in a wide range of contexts, such as customer relationship management, customer value management, sales, and marketing communications. Yet knowledge about the effective application of references in business remains scant, and studies have not addressed in-depth what constitutes customer reference marketing or studied its relation to firm performance. This study contributes to this important but underdeveloped business marketing topic by 1) conceptualizing customer reference marketing based on theory and an extensive qualitative field study, 2) building a measure for the construct using survey data, and 3) demonstrating its relevance by linking the construct to firms' selling performance with additional collected data. The results broaden and specify the current understanding of how to effectively deploy references in business markets and provide evidence of the hypothesized performance, as well as contingency effects. The established conceptual foundations for the phenomenon provide substantial opportunities for practitioners and theory-testing oriented business marketing research.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2017.01.005,"['Customer reference marketing', 'Business-to-business marketing', 'Selling performance', 'Mixed-method research', 'Measurement development', 'Resource-based view']",Industrial Marketing Management,"Customer reference marketing: Conceptualization, measurement and link to selling performance"

3,"In the globally competitive market landscape, companies, in order to remain sustainable, must shift their focus towards constantly improving their PSS offerings by incorporating lean thinking approaches. PSS are complex, dynamic, and multi-dimensional systems, which are supported by appropriate infrastructure and networks. At the same time, PSS require robust engineering methods and tools for their design, which allow multi-dimensional exchange of knowledge between the designers and the relevant stakeholders across the value chain. Currently, enabling technologies such as Cloud technology, social media and networking, knowledge management, and context sensitivity present new possibilities to enhance the knowledge exchange and the collaborative process of PSS design. These technologies allow the gathering and analysis of big volumes of data from scattered heterogeneous IT systems and, at the same time, allow PSS design improvements by processing the experiences of the business customers, consumers, designers, shop-floor, and provide feedback to the design phase. However, a number of challenges are encountered during the gathering, visualization, monitoring, and assessment of related data, such as the lack of context sensitivity. Simultaneously, PSS evaluation approaches are still immature and there is limited work that correlates the impact of the entire PSS lifecycle with the performance assessment of the PSS design. The present work includes a review of the aforementioned technologies from academic, market, and industrial perspectives. Based on an extensive literature review and on constructive discussions with three European SMEs, several barriers and limitations of adopting the aforementioned technologies in practice are identified. Finally, a conceptual eco-innovative framework for lean PSS design is presented, explaining how these technologies could be combined for the improvements of PSS design and evaluation procedures.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2016.03.092,"['Lean PSS', 'Social-media Networking', 'Context Sensitivity']",Procedia CIRP,PSS Design Considering Feedback from the Entire Product-service Lifecycle and Social Media

Starting from a literature review on KMSs used by SMEs and from a focus group with consultants/researchers operating in the field of information technology in SMEs, an empirical investigation was designed, developed and conducted through semi-structured interviews involving 61 selected SMEs operating in high tech industries. The paper highlights three main issues regarding the use of KMSs. Firstly, SMEs adopt and use more intensively traditional tools (KM-Tools) rather than new and more updated ones that are generally cheaper and easier to use. Secondly, SMEs adopt and make more intensive use of practices (KM-Practices) that do not exclusively focus on the knowledge management process, but seek to adapt practices they already know to the requirements of knowledge management. Finally, the paper points out that there is a relationship of reciprocity between KM-Tools and KM-Practices: one reinforces the other and vice versa. The paper proposes a taxonomy bringing together SME strategies for using KMSs. Specifically, four strategies are identified: guidepost, explorer, exploiter, and latecomer.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2016.10.007,"['Field analysis', 'Fuzzy logic', 'Knowledge management systems', 'Practices', 'Tools']",International Journal of Information Management,Using knowledge management systems: A taxonomy of SME strategies
6,"Highlights•Semantic web services in the cloud.•Semantic mash-ups in the cloud.•Semantic cloud and grid architectures.Learning and teaching processes, like all human activities, can be mediated through the use of tools. Information and communication technologies are now widespread within education. Their use in the daily life of teachers and learners affords engagement with educational activities at any place and time and not necessarily linked to an institution or a certificate. In the absence of formal certification, learning under these circumstances is known as informal learning. Despite the lack of certification, learning with technology in this way presents opportunities to gather information about and present new ways of exploiting an individual’s learning. Cloud technologies provide ways to achieve this through new architectures, methodologies, and workflows that facilitate semantic tagging, recognition, and acknowledgment of informal learning activities. The transparency and accessibility of cloud services mean that institutions and learners can exploit existing knowledge to their mutual benefit. The TRAILER project facilitates this aim by providing a technological framework using cloud services, a workflow, and a methodology. The services facilitate the exchange of information and knowledge associated with informal learning activities ranging from the use of social software through widgets, computer gaming, and remote laboratory experiments. Data from these activities are shared among institutions, learners, and workers. The project demonstrates the possibility of gathering information related to informal learning activities independently of the context or tools used to carry them out.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2013.08.004,"['Informal learning recognition', 'Cloud-based information systems', 'Competence', 'Integration', 'TRAILER']",Future Generation Computer Systems,Informal learning recognition through a cloud ecosystem
7,"The so-called real-time web (RTW) is a web of opinions, comments, and personal viewpoints, providing personalized commentary in real-time. Facebook is undoubtedly the king of the RTW. It boasts 1+ billion users that spend about 23 billion minutes per day, generating in the region of 60 million posts per day. This RTW data is far from structured (in contrast to data such as ratings, product features, etc.), but it is very useful to consider for reputation monitoring. For enterprises in particular, being present and aware of what is discussed on social media about their products and services has become a must. It allows them to establish a communication channel with their customers, market their products, build brand equity and boost clientele faithfulness. However, as social media are two-way channels, they require effort and care to manage this communication. Dissatisfied customers can protest out loud, easily influence many other customers and damage the brand's image. In order to avoid these risks, several social media monitoring tools have been implemented, enabling enterprises to have access to real customers’ opinions, complaints and questions at real time in a highly scalable manner. Characteristic examples include the SM2 tool of Alterian, Brandwatch, Converseon, Cymfony Maestro, My BuzzMetrics, Radian6, Sysomos and others. Even though very interesting and somehow effectively performing on open social media (twitter, blogs, microblogs etc), most aforementioned tools have very limited performance on rule-stringent media (where tough access policies are imposed). Furthermore usually extensive human guidance is needed and raw-tag manipulations are necessary. In order to bypass these problems, in this paper we propose an intelligent wrapper system that automatically segments closed social media web pages into structural tokens, extracts and associates opinions to each token. A key step towards retrieving the data of interest is to discover the sections contained in a web page and identify the ones holding the interesting information. To do that, our method is based on a clustering and statistics origin. The proposed system can operate without human intervention and training. Initial experiments are presented over Facebook content, which indicate the promising performance of the proposed scheme.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.07.079,"['Reputation monitoring', 'Social media', 'Wrapper technologies', 'Facebook']",Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences,Reputation Monitoring over Rule-stringent Social Media based on Advanced Wrapper Technologies

This paper aims to stress the role of the brand in that relationship, suggesting a conceptual model in mass-market products in which consumers’ engagement in social media brand communities, brand identity, and consumer-brand identification are related to brand outcomes, such as trust and loyalty. A qualitative analysis was conducted, through in-depth interviews with experts and focus group discussions with consumers, so as to evaluate their experience with brands on social media. The findings indicated that in mass-markets, consumers engaged in social media brand communities may develop positive attitudes towards the brand, such as trust and loyalty, and that consumer-brand identification may have a fundamental role in transforming consumer-brand community interactions into consumer-brand relationships.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jretconser.2018.03.011,"['Consumer-brand identification', 'Consumer engagement', 'Social media', 'Brand loyalty', 'Brand identity']",Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,"On the relationship between consumer-brand identification, brand community, and brand loyalty"

10,"Computer games, which combine exercise and playing games, are called exertion games or exergames (EG). Various studies have dealt with the role of EG with respect to improving physical activity. Others have suggested design guidelines and player types and several have investigated motivational aspects. Very little, however, is still known about the sustainability of motives - even though a long-term use of EG would be essential to achieve goals such as health benefits or prevention of overweight. To get a better understanding of this aspect, our paper outlines and discusses the main motives for playing EG and tries to relate them to long-term motivation.Data on long-term motivation has been collected in a retrospective analysis using an online questionnaire that has been returned by n=54 active or formerly active EG players. Motives for playing and stopping playing were queried. Motives investigated were fun, doing sports, health, losing weight, competition, and affiliation. Based on current literature discussion, these six motives were grouped into those presumed to provide long-term motivation and those which are commonly perceived to decrease it. The scoring on these different motives was then compared between two subject groups: The long-term motivated players, who have been playing for more than six months (and are still continuously doing it) and those who have stopped playing (not long-term motivated players).There were no significant differences between the two player groups with respect to the scorings of the analyzed motives. Concerning the impact of unfulfilled perceptions that make players quit playing EG results were significant. Players strongly motivated by the motives doing sports, health and losing weight indicated that they quitted playing EG due to the fact that their expectations concerning physical activity, having health benefits and weight loss were not fulfilled.This survey could not support the idea, that certain motives, generally associated with playing EG, are predictors for long-term use. This finding however might be due to the relatively small sample size as our data shows the tendency that motives fun and affiliation increase probability for long-term motivation, whereas motives such as doing sports, losing weight, health, and competition do not seem to be correlated with it.As an experimental approach to investigate long-term effects using standardized protocols would certainly contradict the nature of playing games, it seems necessary to follow-on with our method to collect additional data for more statistical power.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proeng.2016.06.310,"['exergames', 'long-term', 'motivation', 'fun', 'sports']",Procedia Engineering,Which Motives are Predictors for Long-term Use of Exergames?
11,"Highlights•A respondent prequalifying framework is proposed to increase survey response rates.•It is for social media initiated surveys with non-probabilistic sampling platform.•The proposed framework is successful in decreasing survey non-response rates.•Assigning score weights to each factor in the framework is crucial to its effectiveness.•The framework improves non-response costs and enhances survey efficiency.The use of web-based surveys is currently increasing due to its cost-effectiveness and agility as it provides access to market researchers to web-connected populations who are unlikely to answer through traditional survey methods. However, survey response rates in market research are in general decline and among survey platforms, web-based surveys have the highest rates of non-response. Thus, there is a need to address the declining response rates for web-based surveys particularly unit response rates – the likelihood the respondent would answer the survey. This paper proposes a respondent prequalifying framework that reduces unit non-response rates of web-based non-probabilistic surveys. A checklist of respondent characteristics influencing the likelihood of unit non-response was developed. The framework was then adopted for its applicability by replicating the recruitment phase of two case studies wherein the prequalifying checklist was applied with consideration to the respondent profile requirements of each study. While this paper does not intend to provide robust empirical evidence to the proposed framework, it demonstrates a promising framework that can be used to increase unit non-response rate by comprehensively integrating the pre-qualifying factors in the domain literature and carefully developing such framework to the most plausible direction a web-survey can be implemented. Findings suggest that (1) the proposed respondent prequalifying framework increases the unit response by prequalifying the sample in the recruitment stage, and (2) increasing the threshold value may increase unit response rates with careful consideration to some significant issues such as the weights assigned to the prequalifying factors, the quality of the background information of the respondents in relation to the prequalifying factors, and the sensitivity of the survey topic. The proposed framework is developed with strong theoretical grounding and detailed discussion for its practical use is also provided. The framework benefits market researchers by reducing unit non-response costs and increasing efficiency in social media-based market surveys.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ausmj.2018.04.001,"['Unit non-response', 'Web-based surveys', 'Facebook', 'Prequalifying checklist', 'Respondents']",Australasian Marketing Journal (AMJ),An exploration of a respondent pre-qualifying framework to increase response rates in social media initiated online surveys
12,"The process of value creation was traditionally driven almost exclusively within the firm. Product design and production were performed with minimal input from consumers, and the role of the consumer was witnessed only at the end of the product development process. Co-creation is generally considered by innovative firms that seek to achieve or maintain strategic competitiveness in the marketplace as a highly valuable progression in open innovation. Although extensive research results exist on innovation co-creation between firms and consumers, a coherent understanding of the application of such co-creation in mobile environments is missing in the literature. We consider opportunities that mobile technologies introduce to further develop co-creation. Based on an extensive literature review of innovation co-creation processes and ecosystems, we identify the key problems, issues, and requirements.

20,"For financial institutions mobile banking has represented a breakthrough in terms of remote banking services. However, many customers remain uncertain due to its security. This study develops a technology acceptance model that integrates the innovation diffusion theory, perceived risk and trust in the classic TAM model in order to shed light on what factors determine user acceptance of mobile banking applications. The participants had to examine a mobile application of the largest European bank. In the proposed model, an approach to external influences was included, theoretically and originally stated by Davis et al. (1989). The proposed model was empirically tested using data collected from an online survey applying structural equation modeling (SEM). The results obtained in this study demonstrate how attitude determine mainly the intended use of mobile apps, discarding usefulness and risk as factors that directly improve its use. Finally, the study shows the main management implications and identifies certain strategies to reinforce this new business in the context of new technological advances.ResumenPara las entidades financieras la banca para móviles ha representado una innovación en términos de servicios de banca remota.

23,"Interaction between the University and students starts from the student enrols into University as a freshman over the period in which the student lives on campus. Cooperation between University and students has occurred since admission until graduation. When students graduate and then begin their work, the only thing that can make an engagement to alumni is the Alumni Association. Alumni Association will serve as a bridge between the University and alumni. Especially in Thailand, the alumni associations are not much active with enablement of technology as a communication tool for engagement. The problem is lack of communication between alumni and University, this causes consequence problems. For example, the University gets less sponsored by alumni; alumni do not get what they want from University; and so on. The review of literatures in this study concluded that to motivate the participations among alumni members eight factors are needed, e.g. 1) Alumni Demographic, 2) Communications, 3) Value Creation, 4) Awareness, 5) Motivation, 6) Collaboration, 7) Engagement, and 8) Alumni Satisfaction. This study aims to explore an innovative framework for responding to the needs of students and alumni and the alumni relationship management system to support the framework. Evidence from the survey found that University needs cooperation from students and alumni. In contrast, Students and alumni need information from the University as well. The results of the survey findings will lead to further research to identify the factors that contribute to build the innovation of relationship management system that can quickly responses to the Needs of students and alumni.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.04.801,"['Innovation', 'Alumni', 'Communication', 'Engagement', 'Value Creation']",Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences,An Innovation System that can Quickly Responses to the Needs of Students and Alumni

25,"Highlights•We present a set of best practices for developing Web applications.•We present a comparative analysis of the most well-known Web frameworks (JSF, Struts, CakePHP, Grails, Ruby on Rails, Django, Catalyst and Lift).•This analysis impacts in the software engineering community decreasing the number of errors in the implementation phase.•We have developed a set of Web applications applying best practices as proof-of-concept.Choosing the Web framework that best fits the requirements is not an easy task for developers. Several frameworks now exist to develop Web applications, such as Struts, JSF, Ruby on Rails, Grails, CakePHP, Django, and Catalyst. However, Lift is a relatively new framework that emerged in 2007 for the Scala programming language and which promises a great number of advantages and additional features. Companies such as Siemens© and IBM®, as well as social networks such as Twitter® and Foursquare®, have now begun to develop their applications by using Scala and Lift. Best practices are activities, technical or important issues identified by users in a specific context, and which have rendered excellent service and are expected to achieve similar results in similar situations. Each framework has its own best practices whose aim is to facilitate the development of Web applications. However, there is no current comparative analysis that identifies the best practices for Web frameworks. Thus, as its salient contribution, this paper identifies a set of best practices for Web frameworks. Afterwards, these best practices were analyzed and discussed in terms of developing Lift-based Web applications. The identification of these best practices would allow developers to construct more interactive and efficient Lift-based Web applications, integrating features of Web 2.0 technologies with less effort and exploiting the frameworks' benefits. In addition, this paper contains a comparative analysis with Web frameworks such as JSF, Struts, CakePHP, Ruby on Rails, Lift, Django, and Catalyst. Finally, as proof of concept, a set of Lift-based Web applications were developed for this paper by applying best practices such as actors, lazy loading, Comet support, SiteMap, Wiring, HyperText Markup Language, version 5 (HTML5) support, and parallel rendering.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2014.12.004,"['Best practices', 'Lift', 'Scala', 'Web frameworks']",Science of Computer Programming,Analyzing best practices on Web development frameworks: The lift approach

This triggered a need for this research to further our understanding of the influence of social presence on social brand engagement (SBE) and the moderating effects of firm-generated content and consumer commitment. Employing a quantitative survey design, 738 consumers with prior experience in following or engaging with brands on social media were randomly interviewed using an online questionnaire. While social presence positively influence social brand engagement, this relationship is significantly moderated by firm-generated content and the consumers' level of commitment in engaging with the brand. The findings also indicate that SBE encourages consumers to increase their intention to use the brand as well as engage in electronic word of mouth. Further, this study provides insights into the potential role of SBE and social presence in advancing the broader understanding of brand relationship management, brand engagement and social media research. Our conceptualisation of SBE suggests a need for managers to adopt creative strategies that will arouse consumers' interest and attention to participate in such interactions.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2017.10.010,"['Social presence theory', 'Social media', 'Social brand engagement', 'e-WOM', 'Firm generated content']",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,Examining online social brand engagement: A social presence theory perspective

Mismanagement of social media could have significant and unintended consequences for the organisation and its stakeholders. This paper addresses the lack of research in organisational social media management by empirically validating a previously developed conceptual social media stages-of-growth model. Hence, the research objectives are to (1) test empirically that the conceptual stages-of-growth model suits the evolution of social media adoption in organisations, and based on the lessons learned to (2) provide recommendations to revise the empirical model. Furthermore, we propose a three-tier typology for classifying organisations based on the potential of their adopted social media.

33,"Highlights•A new hybrid algorithm (logit leaf model) is proposed for customer churn prediction.•It is designed to perform well in terms of both accuracy and interpretability.•Its competitive performance is apparent from an extensive benchmarking experiment.•Its ability to deliver actionable insights is demonstrated in a case study.Decision trees and logistic regression are two very popular algorithms in customer churn prediction with strong predictive performance and good comprehensibility. Despite these strengths, decision trees tend to have problems to handle linear relations between variables and logistic regression has difficulties with interaction effects between variables. Therefore a new hybrid algorithm, the logit leaf model (LLM), is proposed to better classify data. The idea behind the LLM is that different models constructed on segments of the data rather than on the entire dataset lead to better predictive performance while maintaining the comprehensibility from the models constructed in the leaves. The LLM consists of two stages: a segmentation phase and a prediction phase. In the first stage customer segments are identified using decision rules and in the second stage a model is created for every leaf of this tree. This new hybrid approach is benchmarked against decision trees, logistic regression, random forests and logistic model trees with regards to the predictive performance and comprehensibility. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and top decile lift (TDL) are used to measure the predictive performance for which LLM scores significantly better than its building blocks logistic regression and decision trees and performs at least as well as more advanced ensemble methods random forests and logistic model trees. Comprehensibility is addressed by a case study for which we observe some key benefits using the LLM compared to using decision trees or logistic regression.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2018.02.009,"['OR in marketing', 'Hybrid algorithm', 'Customer churn prediction', 'Logit leaf model', 'Predictive analytics']",European Journal of Operational Research,A new hybrid classification algorithm for customer churn prediction based on logistic regression and decision trees

The generated reports may include profiles of report authors and later be supplemented by information about users who accessed the report, user evaluations of the report, or other social cues. With these features, users can support each other in discovering and filtering valuable information in the context of BI. Users who consider reusing an existing report that was not designed by or for them can now not only peruse the report content but also take the social cues into consideration. We analyze which report features influence their perception of report usefulness. Our analysis is based on the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) which assumes that information recipients are either influenced by the quality of information or peripheral cues. We conduct an experiment with knowledge workers from different companies. The results confirm most hypotheses derived from ELM in the context of BI reports but we also find a deviation from the basic ELM expectations. We find that even people who are able and motivated to scrutinize the report content use community cues to decide on report usefulness in addition to report quality considerations.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2015.01.004,"['Business Intelligence (BI)', 'Influence processes', 'Reuse', 'Enterprise 2.0', 'Social software']",Information Processing & Management,Influence of social software features on the reuse of Business Intelligence reports

37,"Highlights•We propose a new structure for annotating CAD models that can be integrated with PLM systems.•We describe the architecture of a software system to externally manage the design information that is embedded in CAD models.•The proposed mechanism facilitates a cohesive view of product-related information within the design environment.•A prototype was developed to demonstrate the new structures and their integration with two commercial PLM systems with distinct data models.•The prototype was efficiently integrated in a typical production workflow and information was effectively stored, retrieved, and synchronized.As CAD models continue to become more critical information sources in the product’s lifecycle, it is necessary to develop efficient mechanisms to store, retrieve, and manage larger volumes of increasingly complex data. Because of their unique characteristics, 3D annotations can be used to embed design and manufacturing information directly into a CAD model, which makes models effective vehicles to describe aspects of the geometry or provide additional information that can be connected to a particular geometric element. However, access to this information is often limited, difficult, and even unavailable to external applications. As model complexity and volume of information continue to increase, new and more powerful methods to interrogate these annotations are needed.In this paper, we demonstrate how 3D annotations can be effectively structured and integrated into a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system to provide a cohesive view of product-related information in a design environment. We present a strategy to organize and manage annotation information which is stored internally in a CAD model, and make it fully available through the PLM. Our method involves a dual representation of 3D annotations with enhanced data structures that provides shared and easy access to the information. We describe the architecture of a system which includes a software component for the CAD environment and a module that integrates with the PLM server. We validate our approach through a software prototype that uses a parametric modeling application and two commercial PLM packages with distinct data models.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2017.06.002,"['3D annotations', 'PLM', 'PDM', 'Design intent', 'Model-based engineering']",International Journal of Information Management,On the integration of model-based feature information in Product Lifecycle Management systems

Hence, this study takes a quantitative (survey design) approach to empirically examine the user (consumer) level factors that influence social media use, their consequences, and the moderating effects of consumer demographic variables (age and gender). The findings suggest that while external pressure from a consumer's referent group influence their social media use, the consumer's personal values does not. Moreover, social media use generates bridging social capital and subjective wellbeing among consumers. The empirical analysis also shows that consumer demographic variables (age and gender) do not have any significant differences in their use of social media. We shed light on the relative effects of these antecedents on social media use from a holistic perspective employing the social presence theory. This study also contributes to the augmentation and displacement hypotheses of computer-mediated communication and tends to support the augmentation hypothesis. The results will also be useful for firms by employing techniques that would arouse interest and curiosity to attract the attention of social media users.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2017.06.023,"['Social media use', 'Social presence theory', 'Subjective wellbeing', 'Augmentation hypothesis', 'Structural equation modelling']",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,Evaluating individual level antecedents and consequences of social media use in Ghana

Considering the fact that many trustworthiness evaluation problems require not only objective measurement but also subjective perception, this paper designs a novel framework named CSTrust for conducting cloud service trustworthiness evaluation by combining QoS prediction and customer satisfaction estimation. The proposed framework considers how to improve the accuracy of QoS value prediction on quantitative trustworthy attributes, as well as how to estimate the customer satisfaction of target cloud service by taking advantages of the perception ratings on qualitative attributes.

However, there have been very few studies that explore the influence of the external environment on key account relationships, especially within the context of emerging economies. This study draws on the network approach and contingency theory to identify and highlight the influence of external environmental factors on the management of inter-organisational relationships with key customers in emerging economies in the Arab Middle East region. It is based on an extensive qualitative enquiry that utilises 50 in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted in Jordan with endogenous and Western firms. It concludes that key account practices within an Arab context are shaped by a number of contingencies that are embedded in broader institutional contexts and the business environment, which may challenge the adoption of company-wide universal key account management policies across borders.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2014.02.008,"['Key account management', 'Relationship management', 'Emerging economies', 'Contingency theory', 'Network approach']",Industrial Marketing Management,Environmental factors influencing the management of key accounts in an Arab Middle Eastern context

Second, the learning analytics begins with securing sufficient data, and a data exchange system should be established for setting up the data ecology. Third, as big data are applied to public data and the corporate business areas and frequently mentioned in the media, the expectation for their potential growth is reaching its peak.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2016.07.096,"['Big-Data', 'Learning analytics', 'Horizon Report', 'Predictive Analytics']",Procedia Computer Science,A Study on the Application of Big Data to the Korean College Education System

44,"Our next generation of industry—Industry 4.0—holds the promise of increased flexibility in manufacturing, along with mass customization, better quality, and improved productivity. It thus enables companies to cope with the challenges of producing increasingly individualized products with a short lead-time to market and higher quality. Intelligent manufacturing plays an important role in Industry 4.0. Typical resources are converted into intelligent objects so that they are able to sense, act, and behave within a smart environment. In order to fully understand intelligent manufacturing in the context of Industry 4.0, this paper provides a comprehensive review of associated topics such as intelligent manufacturing, Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled manufacturing, and cloud manufacturing. Similarities and differences in these topics are highlighted based on our analysis. We also review key technologies such as the IoT, cyber-physical systems (CPSs), cloud computing, big data analytics (BDA), and information and communications technology (ICT) that are used to enable intelligent manufacturing. Next, we describe worldwide movements in intelligent manufacturing, including governmental strategic plans from different countries and strategic plans from major international companies in the European Union, United States, Japan, and China. Finally, we present current challenges and future research directions.

In addition, these terminals act as feeding point to different transport modalities such as rail, road, naval and air. The fast growth g of container volumes handled at the terminals has the g consequence of congestion and by extension will affect the supply chain of g several companies. To improve the intermodal transport, we must improve the performance of terminal operations, especially the harbor container terminal (HCT). In order to be efficient, the HCTs logistics sector has to reach a certain business process maturity. One strong recommendation to reduce non-compliance with the top management strategy is through auditing and assessment of processes. The organizations are required to implement appropriate governance and compliance with applicable laws and best practices. Consequently, the aim of this article is to understand the functioning and the issues related to the HCTs management. To achieve that, this article proposes a study of HCT processes. It presents a diagnostic solution of non-compliances generated by HCTs processes. Then shows an original and practical approach based on the structural analysis. This approach helps the HCT logistics organizational structure assessment. This research fits into organizational audit issues solving. The auditing will affect the operational aspects of the analytical methods implementation. This organizational reengineering will be based on its existing information system.

46,"Highlights•A history of tillage in the productive Central Valley of California 1930–present is chronicled.•Major tillage system transformations beginning in 1990s.•Tillage system innovation in an intensive production region is shown.•Role of global farmer-to-farmer communication is discussed.The Central Valley (CV) of California is a remarkably productive agricultural region. Much of the productive capacity of the CV stems from the reliable tillage management systems that were developed beginning in the 1930s and that changed very little until the 1990s and even more dramatically in the 2000s. A variety of technologies, people and social networks have contributed to the major transformations in tillage management that have rapidly occurred during this recent time. Factors that influenced the prior slow evolution of tillage systems in the region include the need to find ways to farm with irrigation, cope with a broad range of soils, achieve high crop quality and yields to compete on world markets, expand farming operations to greater acreage, and find ways to farm with ever-increasing costs. The cost increases, recognition of the emerging concepts of conservation agriculture (CA), and the development and broader adoption of advanced irrigation systems are now spurring farmers and research organizations in the CV to overcome problems experienced with conventional tillage practices and to develop new cropping systems in the region including no-tillage and strip-tillage. Ultimately, broader adoption of conservation agriculture principles and practices in this region will stem from a diverse and complex set of motivating factors. The role of global farmer-to-farmer communication has had a major impact on this process. Ongoing targeted problem-solving efforts addressing weed, water and fertility management in conservation agriculture systems will be needed to make them more reliable and widely used.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2015.10.015,"['No-tillage', 'Conservation agriculture', 'Controlled traffic farming', 'Adoption', 'Cropping systems']",Soil and Tillage Research,A history of tillage in California’s Central Valley
47,"Highlights•This study distinguishes the different roles of three social commerce components on customers’ decision process.•Cognitive appraisal has a higher predictive power on purchase behavior than affective appraisal.•Learning from forums and communities formulates more affective appraisal than cognitive appraisal.•Learning from ratings and reviews determines more cognitive appraisal than affective appraisal.The proliferation of social commerce has changed customers’ purchase decision-making process. However, few studies have investigated the roles of social commerce factors on customers’ purchase decision-making. Based on the social learning theory, we develop a research model to examine how customers’ learning behavior along three main social commerce components (SCCs) affects customers’ attitude in both cognitive and affective dimensions and how such attitude determines customers’ purchase intention. The results from a survey of 243 actual users of social commerce websites suggest that cognitive and affective appraisals are the main predictors of purchase intention, with cognitive appraisal having a higher predictive power than affective appraisal. In addition, learning from forums and communities and learning from ratings and reviews have significant influences on both cognitive and affective appraisals, while learning from forums and communities plays a more important role in formulating affective appraisal and learning from ratings and reviews plays a more important role in determining cognitive appraisal. Contrary to our expectation, learning from social recommendations has no significant influence on either cognitive or affective appraisal. In summary, these findings provide a comprehensive understanding about customers’ purchase decision-making process and extend the application scope of social learning theory. The findings also provide social commerce managers guidance in designing more effective websites and allocating resources and efforts reasonably on different SCCs.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2017.05.001,"['Social commerce components', 'Social learning theory', 'Forums and communities', 'Ratings and reviews', 'Social recommendations']",International Journal of Information Management,Customers’ purchase decision-making process in social commerce: A social learning perspective

Using the resource-based theory (RBT), the authors propose an integrative conceptual framework in which a firm's relationships with multiple stakeholders drive corporate brand equity, which then leads to firm performance. The empirical analysis features firm-level, secondary data from a sample of 282 firm-year observations obtained from 81 multinational companies during 2005–2008. The empirical results indicate a positive relationship between the quality of stakeholder relations and brand equity. Furthermore, brand equity mediates the link between stakeholder relations and firm performance.

50,"Cloud computing is an attractive computing model since it allows for the provision of resources on-demand. Cloud computing has emerged as a new technology that has got huge potentials in enterprises and markets. Clouds can make it possible to access applications and associated data from anywhere. Companies are able to rent resources from cloud for storage and other computational purposes so that their infrastructure cost can be reduced significantly. Hence there is no need for getting licenses for individual products. Cloud Computing offers an interesting solution for software development and access of content with transparency of the underlying infrastructure locality. The Cloud infrastructure is usually composed of several data centers and consumers have access to only a slice of the computational power over a scalable network. The provision of these computational resources is controlled by a provider, and resources are allocated in an elastic way, according to consumers’ needs. However one of the major pitfalls in cloud computing is related to optimizing the resources being allocated. The other challenges of resource allocation are meeting customer demands and application requirements. In this paper, modified round robin resource allocation algorithm is proposed to satisfy customer demands by reducing the waiting time.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2016.05.278,"['Cloud', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cloud Users', 'Cloud Services', 'Resource Allocation', 'Customer Demand', 'Infrastructure', 'Resource Allocation Algorithm']",Procedia Computer Science,Modified Round Robin Algorithm for Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing
51,"When two companies merge, technical infrastructures change, formal security policies get rewritten, and normative structures clash. The resultant changes typically disrupt the prevalent security culture, thus making the new organization highly vulnerable. Literature in this area has been rather scant, and there is a lack of empirical studies. In this paper, we use Hall's (1959) theory of cultural message streams to evaluate disruptions in security culture following a merger. We carry out an extensive case study of a telecom firm. Data were collected whilst the merger was taking place, which allowed us to evaluate the changing structures in real time. Findings from our analysis will be beneficial for researchers and practitioners alike. For researchers, it provides an opportunity to theorize about security culture formulation during a merger.

54,"Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is an emerging technology that has gained ever-increasing popularity, which makes the generation and large-scale collection of private personal data possible. However, new security issues arise when MCC offers big data analytics and management services. In particular, there is an absence of fine-grained secure access control model to protect privacy information from unauthorized access, especially launched by internal malicious nodes with legal identity and authority. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a reputation and mechanism design based trustworthy access control model (RMTAC) to provide secure and privacy-aware big data access control in MCC. The RMTAC integrates the access control scheme with Vickrey–Clark–Groves (VCG) based adaptive reputation mechanism (VARM), the distributed multi-level security scheme and the hierarchical key management protocol to provide secure and privacy-aware access control and defend against the internal attacks. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the VARM in terms of utility, effective recommendation rate, and accuracy rate compared to the existing reputation mechanisms. Moreover, the RMTAC shows better performance in terms of success rate of malicious access and successful acceptance rate compared to the role-based encryption access control model (RBE) mechanism, in the presence of collusion attacks, bad mouthing attacks and information disclosure attacks.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adhoc.2015.07.007,"['Big data', 'Mobile cloud computing', 'Access control', 'Reputation', 'Mechanism design']",Ad Hoc Networks,A trustworthy access control model for mobile cloud computing based on reputation and mechanism design
55,"Virtual worlds (VWs) have emerged as a new context for gaming, collaboration, social networking but also commercial activity. This paper focuses on the latter, and investigates how consumers behave in this virtual context when selecting stores they visit or buy from. The paper explores store selection criteria in virtual world stores and extends earlier research in both offline and online commercial environments, taking into account the novel IT capabilities that VWs exploit. Theoretical insights drawn from the marketing and information systems literature have been used to guide the design of a survey conducted in the virtual world Second Life. In addition to identifying the factors influencing store selection, the paper investigates how these differ between shoppers and non-shoppers, and identifies the factors that affect the amount of money spent in virtual world shopping environments. The findings suggest that “Core Store Features” and “Security and Privacy” constitute the most important store selection factors in virtual environments and that sales in VWs are predicted by the frequency of visiting and the time spent within VWs’ stores. Building on these findings, the paper discusses theoretical and practical implications and further research perspectives in the context of (3D) online commerce.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.im.2014.05.017,"['Virtual Worlds (VWs)', 'V-Commerce', 'Store selection criteria', 'Virtual reality retailing (VRR)']",Information & Management,Store selection criteria and sales prediction in virtual worlds

Using a two by two crowdfunding motivation framework, we analyzed six relevant funding motivations—interest, playfulness, philanthropy, reward, relationship, and recognition—and identified four types of crowdfunding sponsors: angelic backer, reward hunter, avid fan, and tasteful hermit. They are profiled in terms of the antecedents and consequences of funding motivations. Angelic backers are similar in some ways to traditional charitable donors while reward hunters are analogous to market investors; thus they differ in their approach to crowdfunding. Avid fans comprise the most passionate sponsor group, and they are similar to members of a brand community. Tasteful hermits support their projects as actively as avid fans, but they have lower extrinsic and others-oriented motivations. The results show that these sponsor types reflect the nature of crowdfunding as a new form of co-creation in the E-commerce context.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.elerap.2016.01.006,"['Crowdfunding', 'Co-creation', 'E-commerce', 'Customer typology', 'Motivation', 'Personality', 'Big-five model']",Electronic Commerce Research and Applications,A typology of crowdfunding sponsors: Birds of a feather flock together?
57,"As surveillance technology advances and becomes more data rich and less intrusive and costly, brands collect vast quantities of customer data in order to gain customer insights to remain competitive. Brands conduct customer surveillance often without considering the consequences on customer relationships. Because of customer surveillance activities, customers may also experience privacy intrusions and turn to customer secrecy strategies that hide or disguise their data. To reduce this reaction, we propose a set of surveillance prompts to structure market intelligence databases to increase the efficiency of, and thus reduce the quantity of, customer surveillance activities while increasing data integrity and the potential value of customer insights. By discussing the need for brands to collect business and market intelligence, as well as detailing five types of customer data resources, we lay the groundwork for selecting potential customer data resources that best fit a brand's customer insight needs.

58,"Highlights•Sustainability co-creation processes face nontrivial challenges.•Specific tools, instruments and ways of interacting are needed to provide fruitful sustainability outcome.•Sustainability relationship management has not been anchored firm internal yet.•Sustainability co-creation processes have to focus on the whole value chain to guarantee long-term sustainability progress.Sustainability addresses the companies' activities to implement sustainable requirements across the whole value chain. In theory, relationship management and co-creation processes face this challenge. Relationship management emphasizes the on-going relationship between the company and selective stakeholders to enduring entrepreneurial success. Co-creation means including well-selected stakeholders, e.g. customers or suppliers, in the innovation process on a targeted basis. Co-creation processes are predominantly separated from relationship and sustainability innovation management processes in practice. The article intends to contribute theoretically and empirically to this area of research addressing the following research question: How do companies combine co-creation and relationship management approaches with respect to sustainability? An exploratory multiple case study design was used in order to meet this background. In the period of March 2006 until December 2011 nine mainly German-based companies were analyzed for their co-creation and relationship management processes using different tools like innovation workshops or idea competitions. In addition, several company representatives were interviewed. Content analysis and action research, including observation, were used. This study highlights the lack in integrating sustainability co-creation and relationship management. Co-creation processes are not yet focused on the whole value chain, and thus, mostly do not integrate different stakeholders in order to minimize negative social and ecological impacts. Sustainability relationship management has to be anchored in a specific department. Sustainability innovation management should consider that the used tools and the way of interacting with stakeholders have an influence on the process' outcome and the sustainability impact.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.03.059,"['Co-creation', 'User integration', 'Sustainable development', 'Sustainability open innovation', 'Relationship management', 'Case study design']",Journal of Cleaner Production,Fostering sustainability by linking co-creation and relationship management concepts

Travelers not only reserve hotels and airline tickets online, but also exchange travel information and descriptions of pleasant or unpleasant travel experiences through online review sites and personal travel blogs. In spite of the increasing use of online channels, application of online text data has been limited since the volume of the data set is too large to analyze manually and comprehensively. With recent technological advances in processing big data online, consumer-generated information can be automatically analyzed by artificial intelligence.As an aspect of smart tourism, this study applied the sentiment analysis method to analyze travelers' online reviews of Paris. A total of 19,835 pieces of review data collected from a traveler review site (www.virtualtourist.com) were processed. All reviews were grouped into 14 categories as follows: overview, restaurants, sightseeing, hotels, things to do, night life, transportation, shopping, sporting & outdoors, favorites, off the beaten path, what to pack, tourist traps, warnings and danger, and local customs. Tourists' perception about the service in each category was successfully measured, and as an illustration, we chose “transportation” category that reported relatively low level of service quality for post-hoc analysis to reveal why tourists feel negatively about the transportation service.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2017.01.001,"['Smart tourism', 'Smart destination management', 'Sentiment analysis', 'Text mining', 'User-generated content (UGC)']",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,What makes tourists feel negatively about tourism destinations?

In 2004, the book by Hohpe and Woolf on Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) provided a fundamental collection of messaging patterns, denoting the building blocks of many EAI system implementations. Since then, multiple new trends and a broad range of new application scenarios have emerged, e. g., cloud and mobile computing, multimedia streams. These developments ultimately lead to conceptual changes and challenges such as larger data volumes (i. e., message sizes), a growing number of messages (i. e., velocity) and communication partners, and even more diverse message formats (i. e., variety). However, the research since 2004 focused on isolated EAI solutions, and thus a broader and integrated analysis of solutions and new patterns is missing. In this survey, we summarize new trends and application scenarios which serve as a frame to structure our survey of academic research on EIP, existing systems for EAI and also to classify integration patterns from these sources. We evaluate recently developed integration solutions and patterns in the context of real-world integration scenarios.

64,"Coopetition strategy is often considered critical for firm performance (Gnyawali, He & Madhavan, 2008; Yami, Castaldo, Dagnino & Le Roy, 2010). However, this paradoxical strategy creates tension, especially when coopetition occurs within an organization (Tsai, 2002; Luo, Slotegraaf & Pan, 2006). This paper addresses existing knowledge gaps by providing the first analysis of the specific managerial methods and the key approaches needed to reduce internal tensions within multi-unit and multi-brand organizations. Using an in-depth study approach in the banking industry, we examine two exemplary cases: Crédit Agricole (CA), which is the leading bank in France and the third leading bank in Europe, and Banque Populaire Caisse d'Epargne (BPCE), which is the third leading bank in France. Our findings indicate that firms simultaneously use formal and informal coordination to manage coopetitive goals. Moreover, to reduce tensions due to coopetition, the banks have developed an original organizational model that allows for the distribution of the antagonist powers and fosters integration. The research shows that inter-unit projects balance responsibilities across the firm, while horizontal coordination and social interaction also eliminate blocking and facilitate decision making. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to examine the management of coopetitive tensions within a multi-unit and multi-brand organization.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2015.11.009,"['Management of intra-organizational coopetition', 'Multi-unit and multi-brand coopetition', 'Informal and formal management', 'Horizontal management', 'Inter-unit projects']",Industrial Marketing Management,The management of coopetitive tensions within multi-unit organizations

However, the findings are lack of generalization in other industry context. Therefore, as the phenomenon of peer-to-peer (P2P) online transportation in Indonesia, this article replicates the previous study by Tussyadiah (2016) to test consumers’ satisfaction and future intention in different industry context for generalization purposes. Using Structural Equational Modelling approach, the results among 115 respondents conclude that enjoyment and economic benefit are the determinations of satisfaction while satisfaction itself mediates those variables toward future intention.

69,"Highlights•We present a methodology for the visual segmentation of Facebook users.•We identify visual cues relevant to virtual impression management.•We segment 500 randomly selected Facebook users based on their photos.•We identify five user types: Aloof, Affectionate, Go-getter, Sociable, and Cryptic.•We relate these types to demographics, brand engagement, Facebook usage, and motivations.Conventional segmentation efforts usually focus on verbal or behavioral data while ignoring visual cues, which play a significant role in impression management. Drawing on theoretical work regarding motivations for impression management (need to belong and need for self-promotion), we propose that Facebook users differ from each other in the composition of visual elements they portray in their Facebook profile photos (PPs), and thus can be segmented based on this composition. In this exploratory study we present a methodological proof of concept for the visual segmentation of Facebook users. Using a randomly selected international sample of 500 Facebook accounts, we analyze data implicit in PPs and identify visual cues relevant to virtual impression management. Using these cues we segment users into types, and relate the types to demographics, Facebook usage, and brand engagement as reflected in the Facebook profile. At the theoretical level, the findings suggest that the current accepted motivations for Facebook impression management (need to belong and need for self-promotion) should be expanded to include a third motivation, need for self-expression. At the practical level, the findings demonstrate the utility of visual segmentation, which can later be implemented using computerized systems.Graphical Download full-size image",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intmar.2015.05.002,"['Facebook', 'Impression management', 'Photo analysis', 'Cluster analysis', 'Segmentation', 'Social presence']",Journal of Interactive Marketing,A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words: Segmenting Consumers by Facebook Profile Images

Detecting rare events can be viewed as a prediction task in data mining and machine learning communities. As these events are rarely observed in daily life, the prediction task suffers from a lack of balanced data. In this paper, we provide an in depth review of rare event detection from an imbalanced learning perspective. Five hundred and seventeen related papers that have been published in the past decade were collected for the study. The initial statistics suggested that rare events detection and imbalanced learning are concerned across a wide range of research areas from management science to engineering. We reviewed all collected papers from both a technical and a practical point of view. Modeling methods discussed include techniques such as data preprocessing, classification algorithms and model evaluation. For applications, we first provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the existing application domains of imbalanced learning, and then we detail the applications for each category. Finally, some suggestions from the reviewed papers are incorporated with our experiences and judgments to offer further research directions for the imbalanced learning and rare event detection fields.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2016.12.035,"['Rare events', 'Imbalanced data', 'Machine learning', 'Data mining']",Expert Systems with Applications,Learning from class-imbalanced data: Review of methods and applications

Previous studies mainly focused on factors influencing consumers' willingness to post online reviews, but paid little attention to why posters contribute different content in their reviews. This study aimed to identify various types of positive online reviews in terms of their content and to investigate the mechanisms that influence them. Study 1 conducted a content analysis to verify three types of positive reviews: complimentary, constructive, and prosocial. Study 2 developed a scale to evaluate the three types of reviews and surveyed 526 members of online travel websites in China to test our hypotheses with structural equation modeling. Both complimentary and constructive reviews were positively related to posters' beliefs about firms' appreciation and sincerity, which were promoted by firms' responses to online reviews. Complimentary reviews were positively associated with posters' positive emotions, but negatively affected by belief about a firm's performance-driven motive, which was induced by a firm's request for online reviews. Service quality moderated this negative relationship. Appreciation from peers and peers' prosocial information contributions had a positive effect on the belief that peers' need information-support, which in turn, positively affected prosocial reviews.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2018.01.009,"['Online reviews', 'Social information processing', 'Emotional cues', 'Situational cues', 'Interpretation of cues']",Computers in Human Behavior,Why posters contribute different content in their positive online reviews: A social information-processing perspective

Previous studies have offered conflicting recommendations on whom to target (e.g., influentials, susceptibles, or unsusceptibles) with respect to new product promotions. Utilizing agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS), we show that each of the proposed consumer groups can be a promising target, depending on how they are targeted, according to target size and promotion intensity. The authors further recommend the optimal combination of whom and how to target under budget constraints. Specifically, where a budget is limited, the best approach is to target as many susceptibles as possible with a weak promotion. Targeting unsusceptibles with free products should be the first choice, where the budget is large. In other cases, the best approach is to target as many influentials as possible with a moderate promotion.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2017.10.010,"['Targeting strategies', 'New product diffusion', 'Peer effects', 'Agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS)', 'New product promotion']",Journal of Business Research,Strategies for new product diffusion: Whom and how to target?
75,"Highlights•Highly normalized data warehouse modeling methodology (Anchor Modeling) is observed.•Pros and Cons of highly normalized data model for MPP environment are listed.•Query optimization approach for highly normalized data in a MPP environment is described.•Lessons learned about usage of highly normalized data warehouse in a HP Vertica environment are described.High performance querying and ad-hoc querying are commonly viewed as mutually exclusive goals in massively parallel processing databases. Furthermore, there is a contradiction between ease of extending the data model and ease of analysis. The modern 'Data Lake' approach, promises extreme ease of adding new data to a data model, however it is prone to eventually becoming a Data Swamp – unstructured, ungoverned, and out of control Data Lake where due to a lack of process, standards and governance, data is hard to find, hard to use and is consumed out of context. This paper introduces a novel technique, highly normalized Big Data using Anchor modeling, that provides a very efficient way to store information and utilize resources, thereby providing ad-hoc querying with high performance for the first time in massively parallel processing databases. This technique is almost as convenient for expanding data model as a Data Lake, while it is internally protected from transforming to Data Swamp. A case study of how this approach is used for a Data Warehouse at Avito over a three-year period, with estimates for and results of real data experiments carried out in HP Vertica, an MPP RDBMS, is also presented.

Although smartphone apps are effective tools for retaining customers, few studies have examined consumers’ switching behavior with reference to branded apps. This study applies the push–pull–mooring (PPM) framework to delineate the determinants of consumers’ switching behavior between traditional membership cards and branded apps. Structural equation modeling analysis was conducted on data from 329 users of the myStarbucks app and Starbucks card. The findings indicate that both a push effect, in terms of poor aesthetic design, and pull effects, including locatability, transaction convenience, economic benefits, and gamification, positively affect switching intention. Furthermore, perceived substitutability not only has a direct effect on switching intention but also moderates the relationship between pull effects and switching intention. Finally, in addition to having a direct influence on switching intention, inertia moderates the relationship between push effects and switching intention. This understanding helps managers to develop strategies that can effectively retain consumers through branded apps.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2017.12.042,"['Push–pull–mooring', 'Mobile applications', 'Membership cards']",Computers in Human Behavior,Consumer behavior in switching between membership cards and mobile applications: The case of Starbucks

79,"This paper presents an investigation of the relationships between the factors that drive the adoption of integrated, web-based demand chain management (DCM), as well as the relationship between web-based DCM integration and service innovation performance. Data was collected from 256 companies in the health care industry. The results show that collaborative structure (e.g. competitive pressure, trust, information sharing and environmental uncertainty) and technological structure (e.g. security) have a positive and significant influence on an organization׳s decision to adopt web-based DCM integration. However, collaborative structure has the greatest influence by far on an organization׳s adoption of web-based DCM integration. The findings also show strong evidence that web-based DCM integration improves service innovation performance. We also found that web-based DCM implementation has a greater impact on service innovation performance than in organizations that only implement web-based supply or demand integration strategies. This research has important implications for organizations interested in improving their service innovation performance, as well as improving web-based DCM integration. For example, to improve the success of web-based DCM adoption, organizations should focus on improving their collaborative structure with suppliers and customers first, before considering their technological structure.

80,"Technology developments have transformed the business landscape by accelerating connectivity, transparency and unpredictability. We argue that the most dramatic consequence is not the possibilities created for companies but rather the challenges that emerge as a result of customer behaviour undergoing fundamental changes. Technology transformation has paved the way for empowered customers who are increasingly influencing businesses and markets, and the challenge for practitioners and researchers alike is to make sense of the role of these customers in such business environments. These developments have yielded a need to revise companies’ business models and to innovate new offerings. In scholarly research on marketing, this need has become evident and, beyond suggesting new concepts, completely new marketing management perspectives have been proposed, and each has its own core assumptions and focus. Broader views have emerged, and these stress the applicability of these perspectives not only to the top-level management of businesses but also to any non-commercial organisation.In this article, we reflect on the customer-dominant logic (CDL) of marketing, which stresses the customer's primary role in business. As such, CDL differs from approaches that focus on the provider's perspective. The CDL approach is an expression of the research ideals and goals that are based on the Nordic School of Service Management. We argue that CDL is well aligned with emerging challenges in most markets, both established and nascent, and that it is more managerially relevant than many other perspectives. This is also in line with the recent calls for a soul of relevance for European management research (Chia, 2014; Hernes, 2014).",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.emj.2017.09.005,"['Marketing philosophy', 'Managerial mindsets', 'Customer-dominant logic', 'Service management']",European Management Journal,Reflections on customers’ primary role in markets

84,"Highlights•An algorithm is proposed for building optimal, predictive consumer segmentations.•The method structures existing qualitative knowledge using machine learning.•It extracts predictive rules from data and optimally combines them into segments.•The method is applied to identify predictive segments in a sample of 1M users.•It uncovers homogeneous segments that are 2–3 times more effective for targeting.This paper proposes a predictive segmentation technique for identifying sub-groups in a large population that are both homogeneous with respect to certain patterns in customer attributes, and predictive with respect to a desired outcome. Our motivation is creating a highly-interpretable and intuitive segmentation and targeting process for customers of energy utility companies that is also optimal in some sense. In this setting, the energy utility wants to design a small number of message types to be sent to appropriately-chosen customers who are most likely to respond to different types of communications. The proposed method uses consumption, demographics, and program enrollment data to extract basic predictive patterns using standard machine learning techniques. We next define a feasible potential assignment of patterns to a small number of segments described by expert guidelines and hypotheses about consumer characteristics, which are available from prior behavioral research. The algorithm then identifies an optimal allocation of patterns to segments that is feasible and maximizes predictive power. This is formulated as maximizing the minimum enrollment rate from across the segments, which is then expressed as solving a mixed-integer linear-fractional program. We propose a bisection-based method to quickly solve this program by means of identifying feasible sets. We exemplify the methodology on a large-scale dataset from a leading U.S. energy utility, and obtain segments of customers whose likelihood of enrollment is more than twice larger than that of the average population, and that are described by a small number of simple, intuitive rules. The segments designed this way achieve a 2–3× improvement in the probability of enrollment over the overall population.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.128,"['Segmentation', 'Targeting', 'Energy efficiency']",Applied Energy,Predictive segmentation of energy consumers

Thus, a growing number of companies are attempting to streamline their social commerce platforms to effectively handle reverse logistics. The purpose of this study is to identify the criteria that should be used in designing and evaluating social commerce based reverse logistics processes by firms. We tested the effectiveness of the identified criteria by using them to evaluate the reverse logistics practices of three major global firms that use social commerce platforms. First, we identified the criteria from a thorough review of the literature. Then, we invited five experts to provide (linguistic) ratings of these firms on the selected criteria, using a fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) technique with FLINTSTONES (a software tool) to generate aggregate scores for the assessment and evaluation of reverse logistics practices in social commerce platforms.

It has changed the way how online community interacts and somehow has led to a new trend of engagement for online retailers especially on microblogging websites such as Twitter. In this study, we investigated the impact of online retailers' engagement with the online brand communities on users' perception of brand image and service. Firstly, we analysed the overall sentiment trends of different brands and the patterns of engagement between companies and customers using the collected tweets posted on a popular social media platform, Twitter. Then, we studied how different types of engagements affect customer sentiments. Our analysis shows that engagement has an effect on sentiments that associate with brand image, perception and customer service of the online retailers.

87,"Cloud computing has brought a paradigmatic shift in providing data storage as well as computing resources. With the ever-increasing demand for cloud computing, the number of cloud providers is also increasing evidently, which poses challenges as well as opportunities for consumers and providers. From a consumer point of view, efficient selection of cloud resources at a minimum cost is a big challenge. On the other hand, a provider has to meet consumers’ requirements with sufficient profit in the fiercely competitive market. The relationship between cloud computing is truly symbiotic in the sense that cloud computing makes the practice of analytics more pervasive while analytics makes cloud computing more efficient and optimal in a lot of ways. In addressing these issues, analytics plays an important role. In this paper, we reviewed some important research articles, which focus on cloud computing from the viewpoint of analytics. Analytics and cloud computing are found to be quite interdependent. From analytics perspective, cloud computing makes available high-end computing resources even to an individual customer at an affordable price. We call this thread “Analytics in Cloud”. From the point of view of cloud computing, efficient management, allocation, and demand prediction can be performed using analytics. We call this thread “Analytics for Cloud”. This review paper is mainly based on these two threads of thought process.

A list of noted journals and search results from Science Direct and Web of Knowledge, IEEE Xplore, and INFORMS (approximately 11,000 journal articles) is used to prepare content collection. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is applied as the review and knowledge extraction methodology. Using the text analysis and mining method we can combine statistical methods and expert human judgment to extract knowledge in the form of key latent factors. The LSA based analysis gives the study a scientific grounding which helps to overcome the subjectivity of collective opinion about the trends. This approach allows proposing taxonomy of the research on power influences in supply chain. The adopted systems approach is used to find research gaps in each class of taxonomy. An emerging trend is noticed in the research of behavioral operations in supply chain. Understanding such a scholarly structure and future trends will assist researchers to assimilate the divergent developments of this multidisciplinary research in one place. This review will be beneficial for practitioners as they consider behavioral aspects in decision making.

Sashi's (2012) customer engagement cycle is utilized to compare organizational practices in relation to social media marketing in B2B, B2C, Mixed B2B/B2C and B2B2C business models. Utilizing 449 responses to an exploratory panel based survey instrument, we clearly identify differences in social media usage and its perceived importance as a communications channel. In particular we identify distinct differences in the relationship between social media importance and the perceived effectiveness of social media marketing across business models. Our results indicate that B2B social media usage is distinct from B2C, Mixed and B2B2C business model approaches. Specifically B2B organizational members perceive social media to have a lower overall effectiveness as a channel and identify it as less important for relationship oriented usage than other business models.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2018.01.001,"['Social media', 'Channel management', 'Business-to-business marketing', 'B2B2C marketing', 'Channel effectiveness']",Industrial Marketing Management,"A comparison of social media marketing between B2B, B2C and mixed business models"

From this concern, a couple of speech-act coding schemes were developed from the point of view of ‘what was done by crew members?’ In this study, a novel speech-act coding scheme was developed, which allows us to see the contents crew communication from a different angle – ‘what was the communication intention of crew members?’ To this end, the communication contents uttered by MCR operators who were faced with various kinds of simulated off-normal conditions were collected from the full-scope simulator of domestic NPPs. Then, the novel speech-act coding scheme was developed by involving additional yardsticks (such as Means, Acceptance criteria, and Constraints), which are useful for elucidating the nature of communications from a task description perspective. As a result, the novel speech-act coding scheme was proposed, which consists of 45 behavioral task categories and the associated definitions. Although the novel speech-act coding scheme proposed in this study is still a preliminary version, this would be a good starting point to enhance the quality of crew communications through visualizing their communication intentions.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2018.05.013,"['Crew communication', 'Speech-act coding scheme', 'Communication intention', 'Off-normal condition', 'Nuclear power plant']",Reliability Engineering & System Safety,A novel speech-act coding scheme to visualize the intention of crew communications to cope with simulated off-normal conditions of nuclear power plants

Privacy concern was measured by using concern for social media information privacy (CFSMIP). Therefore, this study proposes and empirically validated a model that combines CFSMIP, brand loyalty, and Expectation Confirmation Model, in the Asian context. The results suggested that users' CFSMIP does not inhibit them from the continuous usage of mobile social commerce, and influences their perceived usefulness on mobile social commerce positively. Moreover, all the paths in the baseline model of Expectation Confirmation Model have been reconfirmed in this study. Besides, users' continuance usage and satisfaction on mobile social commerce are proven to be boosters for brand loyalty.

93,"Internet of Things (IoT) is set to revolutionize all aspects of our lives. The number of objects connected to IoT is expected to reach 50 billion by 2020, giving rise to an enormous amounts of valuable data. The data collected from the IoT devices will be used to understand and control complex environments around us, enabling better decision making, greater automation, higher efficiencies, productivity, accuracy, and wealth generation. Data mining and other artificial intelligence methods would play a critical role in creating smarter IoTs, albeit with many challenges. In this paper, we examine the applicability of eight well-known data mining algorithms for IoT data. These include, among others, the deep learning artificial neural networks (DLANNs), which build a feed forward multi-layer artificial neural network (ANN) for modelling high-level data abstractions. Our preliminary results on three real IoT datasets show that C4.5 and C5.0 have better accuracy, are memory efficient and have relatively higher processing speeds.

94,"Highlights•The research collected data from over 1000 consumers in China and France.•Collectivism-polychronic time orientation affects online social interaction in China.•Social interaction has a stronger effect on trust perception and browsing experience in China.•Trust perception affects intention to use online shopping in China but not France.This study proposes a model of online shopping behavior that examines the influence of collectivism and polychronic time orientation on customers' online social interaction in the context of social media and its influence on psychological reactions to this interaction (i.e., trust perception, browsing experience),which in turn influences behavioral intention to use online shopping. The model is empirically tested and results are compared across French and Chinese cultures. Results of multigroup structural equation modeling using a sample of more than 1000 website visitors in both cultures support the hypotheses and show several non-invariant and invariant paths between the groups. Specifically, the influences of collectivism and polychronic time orientation on Internet users' social interaction are stronger for Chinese respondents than for French respondents. Moreover, the influence of social interaction on trust perception, and of trust perception on intention to use online shopping, is stronger for Chinese respondents than for French respondents. However, the influence of social interaction on browsing experience is similar between the two groups. Finally, the influence of trust perception on intention to use online shopping is found to be not significant for the French sample but significant for the Chinese sample.

Based on the search results, the literature was synthesized, segregated into four major domains according to the purpose, nature and usage of the information technology/systems. The authors believe that this segregation within the information technology & systems continuous usage literature provides greater scalability, flexibility and space for future research. Moreover, this proposed segregation allows for future research to include more ‘systems’ in each category depending on the usage, relevance and nature of the ‘systems’ that will evolve over the period of time.

In this article, the authors provide a typology of CRM approaches adopted by professional sports teams and demonstrate if and how they approach social responsibility from a marketing perspective. The authors use a qualitative method to explore CRM engagement of professional basketball teams in Europe. The findings show that CRM is more than an act of philanthropy to the majority of the sports organisations. The sport organisations envision a win–win situation either through increased revenue or improved stakeholder relationships, or a combination of both. The authors merge the CSR and CRM concept and contribute to the CRM literature by investigating it from a broad managerial and stakeholder perspective rather than from a unilateral consumer perspective. The model will assist sports managers in CRM decision-making, more specifically, in handling the paradox between commercialising CRM and safeguarding integrity.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smr.2017.08.006,"['Corporate social responsibility', 'Marketing', 'Stakeholder management']",Sport Management Review,A typology of cause-related marketing approaches in European professional basketball

0,"Highlights•A PLS-ANN two-staged approach and a non-parametric PLS-MGA are employed.•Brand attachment is the most influential driver of continuance intention to purchase smartphones.•Male consumers are more sensitive to the influences of brand attachment.•Female consumers are stressing more on perceived usefulness.•Perceived usefulness does not significantly influence male consumers’ continuance intention.In this fast changing digital era, smartphones users tend to change their smartphones regularly. Therefore, retaining existing consumers has been a challenging task for smartphone manufacturer brands. Given the status quo in smartphone industry and deficiencies in smartphone research, this study proposes a model that integrates Expectation Confirmation Model and brand attachment to shed light on smartphone repurchase decision making process. Besides, gender differences are also accounted for in the model. This study employs a two-staged approach, namely PLS-ANN, in analysing the data collected from 510 existing smartphone owners. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was firstly engaged, and followed by artificial neural network analysis. Besides, a non-parametric partial least squares multi-group analysis has also been conducted to discover gender differences in such decision making process. The results suggest that brand attachment is the most influential and relevant driver of consumers’ intention to repurchase smartphones from current brand (measured by continuance intention). Moreover, male consumers are more sensitive to the influence of brand attachment in developing their satisfaction and continuance intention, while female consumers are relying more on perceived usefulness. Interestingly, perceived usefulness does not significantly influence male consumers in continuance intention development. Practical and theoretical implications are subsequently offered.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (129KB)Download full-size image",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2016.12.009,"['Smartphone repurchase intention', 'Brand attachment', 'Gender differences', 'Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM)', 'Artificial neural network analysis (ANN)', 'Partial least squares multi-group analysis (PLS-MGA)']",Telematics and Informatics,Crafting a smartphone repurchase decision making process: Do brand attachment and gender matter?
1,"The cloud computing industry is a swiftly growing sector, with many providers hailing it as a “digital revolution” that will render traditional IT business models obsolete within ten years. Although still under development, the range of circumstances to engage in monopolistic and anti-competitive behaviour in the cloud services market are numerous. Suppliers can engage in tying, exclusive dealing, and refusing to share vital information to allow the creation of technically compatible products. Monopolistic behaviour and pricing strategies can also restrict innovation and result in a lessening of competition.This paper reviews the European laws that have a direct effect on competition in the cloud computing industry. In addition to competition law, other areas of law have an impact on competition in cloud services. Merger regulations for example have a direct effect by controlling market concentrations in the cloud and technology industry.Interoperability has emerged as a key policy and legal consideration in cases concerning competition and merger laws. The concept of interoperability has arisen in cloud computing cases, as well as other areas of law that indirectly impact upon openness and competition. These areas include intellectual property and standardisation.As new areas of interest arise that raise enforcement challenges for regulators, the author maintains that current laws are adequate to meet the competition concerns in the diverse cloud services market.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2017.05.005,"['Cloud computing', 'Cloud services', 'Cloud industry', 'Technology law', 'Information technology', 'Interoperability', 'Compatibility', 'Competition law', 'Standardisation']",Computer Law & Security Review,Competition law and interoperability in cloud computing
2,"Highlights⿢A total 110 studies reviewed to clarify social commerce concept using per-defined review protocol.⿢We identify three main characteristics of social commerce that distinguish the term from e-commerce.⿢We highlighted the research themes that have been addressed in previous studies.⿢The results of the review highlighted the limitation and the gaps in the previous studies in three main aspects (theoretical, customer and design aspects).Web 2.0 technologies and social media gave a rise to social commerce as a new phenomenon in the business world. Recently, social commerce gained a major attention from both academics and practitioners. Numerous studies have been conducted to understand s-commerce and examine its impact. Since 2010 the published studies on s-commerce increased, but little attempt has been made to incorporate the findings of former surveys and assess the current state of the research in this field. In this study, we conducted a systematic review of s-commerce research, to explore the term s-commerce by collecting, reviewing and synthesizing studies that related to s-commerce published from 2010 to 2015. By following review protocol which integrated two stages (automatic and manual) to cover all studies in this period, we identified 110 studies which address s-commerce. The results show that the studies that addressing s-commerce increased during the last 6 years. We observed that the current studies covered numerous research themes under s-commerce, such as user behavior, business models, s-commerce website design, adoption strategy, social process network analysis and firm performance. Most of these studies focus on user behavior and website design, while other themes gained little attention; therefore, this study highlights direction for further research. This review reveals s-commerce to be a promising new area of research, showing a new paradigm of conducting commerce using social media to reach customers and their networked friends. Discussion of this and conclusion have been highlighted.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2016.06.005,"['Social commerce', 'Electronic commerce', 'Web 2.0', 'Social media', 'Systematic review']",International Journal of Information Management,Understanding social commerce: A systematic literature review and directions for further research
3,"The high penetration rate of new technologies in all the activities of everyday life is fostering the belief that for any new societal challenge there is always an ICT solution able to successfully deal with it. Recently, the solution that is proposed almost anytime is the “Internet of Things” (IoT). This apparent panacea of the ICT world takes different aspects on and, actually, is identified with different (often very different) technological solutions. As a result, many think that IoT is just RFIDs, others think that it is sensor networks, and yet others that it is machine-to-machine communications. In the meanwhile, industrial players are taking advantage of the popularity of IoT to use it as a very trendy brand for technology solutions oriented to the consumer market. The scientific literature sometimes does not help much in clarifying, as it is rich in definitions of IoT often discordant between them.Objective of this paper is to present the evolutionary stages, i.e., generations, that have characterized the development of IoT, along with the motivations of their triggering. Besides, it analyzes the role that IoT can play in addressing the main societal challenges and the set of features expected from the relevant solutions. The final objective is to give a modern definition of the phenomenon, which de facto shows a strong pervasive nature, and, if not well understood in its theories, technologies, methodologies, and real potentials, then runs the risk of being regarded with suspicion and, thus, rejected by users.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adhoc.2016.12.004,"['Internet of Things', 'Web of things', 'Cloud of things']",Ad Hoc Networks,"Understanding the Internet of Things: definition, potentials, and societal role of a fast evolving paradigm"
4,"Highlights•Privacy fatigue is a multi-dimensional concept including exhaustion and cynicism.•There is a significant effect of privacy fatigue on privacy coping behaviors.•Privacy fatigue has a stronger impact disengagement behavior than privacy concern.The increasing difficulty in managing one's online personal data leads to individuals feeling a loss of control. Additionally, repeated consumer data breaches have given people a sense of futility, ultimately making them weary of having to think about online privacy. This phenomenon is called “privacy fatigue.” Although privacy fatigue is prevalent and has been discussed by scholars, there is little empirical research on the phenomenon. This study aimed not only to conceptualize privacy fatigue but also to examine its role in online privacy behavior. Based on literature on burnout, we developed measurement items for privacy fatigue, which has two key dimensions —emotional exhaustion and cynicism. Data analyzed from a survey of 324 Internet users showed that privacy fatigue has a stronger impact on privacy behavior than privacy concerns do, although the latter is widely regarded as the dominant factor in explaining online privacy behavior.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2017.12.001,"['Online privacy', 'Privacy fatigue', 'Emotional exhaustion', 'Cynicism', 'Disengagement']",Computers in Human Behavior,The role of privacy fatigue in online privacy behavior
5,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between managerial beliefs regarding social media and the subsequent adoption of these tools by exporting companies, and the moderating effect of export dependence measured by export intensity in those relationships. To accomplish this objective we use data from a Web-based survey distributed (by e-mail) to export managers or CEOs of Spanish exporting firms from the ICEX (Spanish Institute for Foreign Trade) database. Our results show that Managers’ beliefs about social media capabilities for dealing with foreign customers directly influence managerial attitudes toward and intention to use social media, and also indirectly on the intention to use them through the attitude. Then, the intention to use these applications increases their final usage by exporting firms. Export dependence of the company moderates all these relationships, being stronger with a higher export intensity.ResumenEl objetivo de este estudio es investigar la relación entre las creencias gerenciales en relación a los medios sociales y la subsiguiente adopción de dichas herramientas por parte de las empresas exportadoras, así como el efecto moderador de la dependencia de la exportación, calibrado mediante la intensidad exportadora en dichas relaciones.

Nuestros resultados reflejan que las creencias de los gestores acerca de las capacidades de los medios sociales, en cuanto al trato con los clientes extranjeros, tienen una influencia directa sobre las actitudes gerenciales frente al uso y a la intención de utilizar los medios sociales, y una influencia indirecta sobre la intención de hacer uso de dichos medios a través de la actitud. Por tanto, la intención de utilizar estas aplicaciones incrementa su uso final por parte de las empresas exportadoras.

However, research on technological innovation centers the development of new technological solutions, while largely neglecting changes in customer problems or needs. This paper develops a typology for use as an analytical framework covering technological innovations and variations in market demand. The typology is then applied to the photographic industry, specifically the development of digital imaging technologies which disrupted existing film material and chemistry technologies in a paradigm shift from analog film to digital cameras. Taking a systematic view of product technologies, the typology identifies seven types of technological changes during the photography industry's process of digitalization. Case studies show that disruption of incumbent competencies can be attributed to the interactive effects of technological innovations and variations to market demand. Adaptive strategies corresponding to the identified types of technological changes are reported and discussed. The proposed typology is designed as a generic framework and is validated using an additional set of case studies from the media industrial sector.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2014.05.015,"['Technological change', 'Technological paradigm', 'Typology', 'Disruptive innovation', 'Industrial sector']",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,A typology of technological change: Technological paradigm theory with validation and generalization from case studies

Recent research has focused primarily on the relationship between sharing economy firms (service enablers) and customers. Moreover, service enablers have primarily allocated their resources to acquire a critical mass of customers. This study takes a balanced two-sided customer relationship approach toward understanding the dynamics of this triadic business model (service enabler – service provider – customer). To maintain this emerging economy's fast-growth pace, service enablers should strive to acquire, retain, and win-back profitable service providers and customers simultaneously.We propose a conceptual strategic framework for the development of service providers and customers considering multigenerational aspects based on inferences from the literature, popular press, and interviews with members of the triad in the sharing economy. Based on our investigation, the sharing economy services are mostly adopted by Generation Y, whereas other generations are still in the early phase of adoption. Additionally, customer and service provider churn is high. We argue that this double-sided customer relationship framework will help firms take appropriate measures to keep all the actors involved in the process satisfied, loyal, and profitable in the long run.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (301KB)Download full-size image",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2017.08.021,"['Sharing economy', 'Two-sided market', 'Churn', 'Customer development', 'Firm performance', 'Multigenerational marketing']",Industrial Marketing Management,A strategic framework for a profitable business model in the sharing economy
9,"Today, development of physical products does not only reflect the notion of tangible objects, but rather those of individualized products with associated services; which bring more value to final customers than the pure physical objects without any accessories and services. Thanks to new achievements in ICT, all product stakeholders (e.g., manufacturers, consumers, service providers) have got the possibility to more intensively interact with each other and thereupon profit from that. This novel approach has led the development features of products to a new era of cyber-physical systems, resulting in higher individualized and user-friendly product experiences, reflecting intelligent and connected products throughout their life-cycles. Accordingly, such products configure product-service systems with accompanying several merits, e.g., flexibility, adaptability, reactivity, expertise, and x-gradability. Prospective products due to their adaptable design, associated services and Avatars are able to cover a range of customizations upon the current and prospective needs of customers.

The study also examines the essential differences between business-to-consumer and business-to-business in these respects. The paper starts by defining social media and Web 2.0, and then characterizes social media in business, and social media in business-to-business. Finally, we present and analyze the results of our empirical survey of 125 business-to-business companies in the Finnish technology industry sector.

12,"Highlights•An RFID-enabled social manufacturing system (RFID-SMS) is developed to deal with real-time monitoring and dispatching of inter-enterprise integrated production and transportation tasks.•Three service packages of RFID-SMS are studied in detail, including RFID data services package, real-time monitoring services package, and decision support services package.•The integrated production and transportation task dispatching problem is modeled and solved by a three-step optimization method integrating teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO).In today's manufacturing environment, manufacturers need to handle unprecedented and diverse customer requirements swiftly. An efficient way is to collaborate with various stakeholders such as micro-/small-/medium-sized enterprises, factories, workshops, logistics service providers, public warehouse providers, and even individuals, forming a social media-based community. The vital factor to enable this way is the efficient real-time monitoring and dynamic dispatching of inter-enterprise production and transportation tasks. This work deals with the social manufacturing trend and proposes an radio frequency identification-enabled social manufacturing system (RFID-SMS) to realize the real-time monitoring and dispatching of inter-enterprise production and transportation tasks. Firstly, RFID devices are systematically deployed in each enterprise's job-shops and transportation vehicles to collect real-time production and transportation data. Then, these data is processed to monitor task progress and states, which is helpful to manage the inter-enterprise production processes.

13,"Creating and developing a firm-hosted virtual brand community forms part of a relationship marketing strategy; therefore, it makes sense to evaluate its effectiveness in terms of relational outcomes. In an attempt to know how marketers can foster the relationship with the brand through virtual communities, we posit and estimate a model of relational efficacy for a firm-managed Facebook brand page (FBP) in which the brand posts created by the firm influence the behavioural engagement of individual users through the utilitarian and hedonic values derived from their interactive experiences within the FBP. The findings highlight that information posts stimulate user behavioural engagement through the utilitarian experiential route. Aside from any experiential route and adopting a more direct path, interaction posts are the main drivers of engagement behaviour. Image posts contribute towards the perception of utility, but in no way affect engagement. Finally, in order to gain a deeper insight, we explore the moderating effect of user brand purchase intensity on the relations posited in the model.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brq.2017.06.001,"['M15', 'M30', 'Facebook brand page', 'Brand post content', 'Experiential value', 'User behavioural engagement']",BRQ Business Research Quarterly,How brand post content contributes to user's Facebook brand-page engagement.

14,"Highlights•A new Chinese text classification model.•Using content analysis to convert important textual information and compile it into a keyword index.•A decision-making algorithm for fuzzy and grey situations is used to categorize textual data.•A company’s database of interactions with customers is used to construct a text mining model.After an enterprise builds a data warehouse, it can record information related to customer interactions using structured and unstructured data. The intention is to convert these data into useful information for decision-making to ensure business continuity. Hence, this study proposes a new Chinese text classification model for the project management office (PMO) using fuzzy semantics and text mining techniques. First, content analysis is performed on the unstructured data to convert important textual information and compile it into a keyword index. Next, a classification and decision algorithm for grey situations and fuzzy (GFuzzy) is used to categorize textual data by three characteristics: maximum impact, moderate impact, and minimum impact. The purpose is to analyze consumer behaviors for the accurate classification of customers. Lastly, a more effective marketing strategy is formulated to target the various customer combinations, growth models, and the best mode of service. A company database of interactions with customers is used to construct a text mining model and to analyze the decision process of its PMO. The purpose is to test the feasibility and validity of the proposed model so that enterprises are provided with better marketing strategies and PMO processes aimed at their customers.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2018.04.003,"['Big data warehouse', 'Content analysis', 'Data mining', 'Fuzzy grey situation decision-making algorithm', 'Project management office', 'Customer relations management']",Computers & Industrial Engineering,Using big data database to construct new GFuzzy text mining and decision algorithm for targeting and classifying customers

17,"It is a reality that advancement of Information Technology revolutionized the business practices and strategies of entire industries. The field of higher education is not an exception to this phenomenon. Colleges and universities around the world are investing considerable amount of money to create Information Technology resources that meet their student's and faculty's instructional needs. While universities encourage their faculties to adopt the new technologies for their preparation and delivery of classes, various other factors influence the integration or resistance of acceptance of these technologies. Age, highest education earned, teaching experience, computer competency, prior computer experience, availability of technology, Institutional support etc. are examples of these factors. Based on the theoretical support of Roger's Diffusion Theory, a conceptual model is developed to identify the critical success factors that influence the adoption of Information Technology among faculties of tertiary educational institutions. The model is empirically tested among the faculty members of leading universities in Asian region. 261 full time lecturers participated in this study and the results show that factors such as computer self-efficacy, relative advantage, compatibility and prior computer experience are significantly influencing their perceived ease of use and attitude towards using educational technologies.ResumenEs una realidad que el avance de la Tecnología de la Información revolucionó las prácticas y estrategias de negocios de industrias enteras.

Hotel check-in process failure was used as the service encounter scenario. Based on the results of a multi-group structural equation modeling analysis, the study identified that concern for face can increase the intention to spread negative word-of-mouth information about service process failure experiences. In contrast, the existence of guanxi between hotels and customers can reduce the intention to terminate transactions or post negative online reviews. In addition, guanxi can moderate the influence that concern for face has on direct complaint intention. When guanxi exists, concern for face motivates customers to complain directly.

In this paper, we link the concept of crowdfunding with the user innovation phenomenon and show how user innovators harness crowdfunding to complement their innovative behavior and obtain funding to build firms and produce products in a more professional way. Conducting three case studies ranging from low- to high-tech crowdfunding campaigns, we investigate how crowdfunding impacts constituent dimensions of user innovation theory such as user motivation, user role, user community, collaboration between users and user investments. In particular, we argue that crowdfunding platforms (CFPs) may give rise to a more widespread occurrence of user entrepreneurs, who found a firm to commercialize their product or service in a marketplace they have created for their own need. Hence, we show the development from traditional user innovation to crowdfunding-enabled user innovation, which democratizes not only the creation but also the more large-scale commercialization of new products and services.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2017.11.020,"['User innovation', 'Crowdfunding', 'Crowdsourcing', 'Crowdfunding platform', 'Entrepreneurship', 'User communities', 'User entrepreneur']",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,How crowdfunding platforms change the nature of user innovation – from problem solving to entrepreneurship

Longitudinal individual and engagement behavioral data generated on social media sites post challenges to integrate diverse heterogeneous data to improve prediction performance in customer response modeling. In this study, a hierarchical ensemble learning framework is proposed for behavior-aware user response modeling using diverse heterogeneous data. In the framework, a general-purpose data transformation and feature extraction strategy is developed to transform the heterogeneous high-dimensional multi-relational datasets into customer-centered high-order tensors and to extract attributes. An improved hierarchical multiple kernel support vector machine (H-MK-SVM) is developed to integrate the external, tag and keyword, individual behavioral and engagement behavioral data for feature selection from multiple correlated attributes and for ensemble learning in user response modeling. The subagging strategy is adopted to deal with large-scale imbalanced datasets. Computational experiments using a real-world microblog database were conducted to investigate the benefits of integrating diverse heterogeneous data. Computational results show that the improved H-MK-SVM using longitudinal individual behavioral data exhibits superior performance over some commonly used methods using aggregated behavioral data and the improved H-MK-SVM using engagement behavioral data performs better than using only the external and individual behavioral data.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2014.09.008,"['Data mining', 'Direct marketing', 'Response modeling', 'Social media', 'Engagement behavior']",European Journal of Operational Research,"Behavior-aware user response modeling in social media: Learning from diverse heterogeneous data

Study addresses a research gap by developing conceptually grounded and psychometrically sound scale of co-created value. Derived from service-dominant logic and theory of value, co-created value is conceptualized as a personal appraisal of the meaningfulness of a service based on what is contributed and what is realized through collaboration. The scale development and validation followed multi-step multi-stage methodology and verified the measure in different tourism and hospitality contexts. The analyses resulted in 25-item 5-dimension original scale representing: meaningfulness, contribution, collaboration, recognition and emotional response. The co-created value scale was tested for concurrent validity using consumer loyalty as a part of the nomological network, with antecedents operationalized as openness and authenticity and consequences as well-being, competitive advantage, commitment, and trust.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2017.09.014,"['Co-created value', 'Scale development', 'Service-dominant logic', 'Wellbeing', 'Service advantage', 'Trust']",Tourism Management,Co-created value: Multidimensional scale and nomological network

However, while the literature acknowledges the importance of these topics little work has addressed them from the organization's point of view. This paper investigates the challenges faced by organizational managers seeking to become more data and information-driven in order to create value. Empirical research comprised a mixed methods approach using (1) a Delphi study with practitioners through various forums and (2) interviews with business analytics managers in three case organizations. The case studies reinforced the Delphi findings and highlighted several challenge focal areas: organizations need a clear data and analytics strategy, the right people to effect a data-driven cultural change, and to consider data and information ethics when using data for competitive advantage. Further, becoming data-driven is not merely a technical issue and demands that organizations firstly organize their business analytics departments to comprise business analysts, data scientists, and IT personnel, and secondly align that business analytics capability with their business strategy in order to tackle the analytics challenge in a systemic and joined-up way. As a result, this paper presents a business analytics ecosystem for organizations that contributes to the body of scholarly knowledge by identifying key business areas and functions to address to achieve this transformation.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2017.02.023,"['Analytics', 'Delphi', 'Management challenges', 'Value creation', 'Ecosystem']",European Journal of Operational Research,Management challenges in creating value from business analytics

28,"Highlights•Strong strategic capability: Vietnam Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Garuda Indonesia.•Air India, Thai Airways, Philippine Airlines have notably weaker capabilities.•Network airlines in Northeast Asia must especially strengthen their capabilities.•Strong strategic capability does not mean it is properly or fully leveraged.•The correlation between strategic capability and performance is reasonably strong.Never before have network airlines been so exposed and vulnerable to low-cost carriers (LCCs). While LCCs had 26.3% of all world seats in 2013, Southeast Asia had 57.7% and South Asia 58.4% – and these figures will only increase. There are many consequences of LCCs on network airlines, including inadequately meeting the expectations of customers, so increasing dissatisfaction, and not offering sufficient value-for-money. Clearly, it is fundamentally important for Asian network airlines to respond appropriately to LCCs. This paper looks at the strategic capability of 22 of the top Asian network airlines in competing with LCCs, which is achieved by analysing questionnaire data from these airlines in terms of 37 competitive responses across six distinct response categories. It is crucial to note that this paper only concerns their capability in competing with LCCs, and it does not consider their overall strength. This paper also investigates how strategic capability varies by Asian sub-region and by airline performance, with performance examined in two respects: by perceived performance and actual performance. The results show that strategic capability varies widely, with Vietnam Airlines possessing the strongest strategic capability to compete with LCCs and SilkAir the weakest. Of others that compete heavily with LCCs, Malaysia Airlines and Garuda Indonesia have strong capabilities, while Philippine Airlines does not. However, all three need to more forcefully respond to LCCs. As a whole, network airlines within Southeast Asia have the greatest strategic capability, and Northeast Asia the weakest. There is a reasonably strong correlation between strategic capability and both actual and perceived performance, which suggests that those airlines with strong strategic capabilities should achieve strong overall performance.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jairtraman.2015.03.006,"['Competition', 'Competitive responses', 'Competitive advantage', 'Asia', 'Network airlines', 'Low-cost carriers']",Journal of Air Transport Management,The strategic capability of Asian network airlines to compete with low-cost carriers

A conceptual model, which draws on the technology acceptance model and resource-based theory, is developed and tested using quantitative data from B2B organizations in the UK. Findings suggest that perceived usefulness of social media within B2B organizational contexts is determined by image, perceived ease of use and perceived barriers. Additionally, the results show that adoption of social media is significantly affected by organizational innovativeness and perceived usefulness. The moderating role of organizational innovativeness is also tested but no support is found.

38,"Highlights•Late payment prediction models are developed based on machine-learning algorithms.•Ten scoring rules are suggested based on the predicted payment likelihood.•The proposed methods are verified using actual customer databases.•The robustness of the proposed models is verified under different numbers of customers.Debt collection via call centers is an important operation in many business domains since it can significantly improve a firm's financial status by turning bad receivables into normal cash income that contributes to profits. Since the job performance of call center agents who carry out debt collection is primarily evaluated by the amount of debt collected, call center managers are faced with the challenge of allocating customer contact lists in a fair manner to eliminate a non-controllable external factor that could distort the objective evaluation of the agent's job performance. In this paper, we develop five machine learning-based late payment prediction models and ten customer scoring rules to predict the payment likelihood and the amount of the late payment for the customers who currently have an unpaid debt. The proposed scoring rules are verified under ten different contexts by varying the number of agents. Experimental results confirm that the prediction model-based scoring rules lead to fairer customer allocation results among the agents compared to the existing heuristic-based customer scoring rules. Among the prediction models, a hybrid approach can capture the late payers effectively, whereas tree-based models report more impartial customer allocation than the other methods.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2016.03.002,"['Late payment prediction', 'Machine learning', 'Decision tree', 'Artificial neural network', 'Support vector machine', 'Hybrid approach']",Decision Support Systems,Late payment prediction models for fair allocation of customer contact lists to call center agents

A literature review analyses how the web 2.0 transforms the implementation of KM by supporting conversational and collaborative KM processes that in turn divert KM from a technology-centric to a people-centric approach. The discussion also reveals how different ways of exploiting web 2.0 reflect different levels of technology supported KM practices. The study also investigated the type and the level of web 2.0 exploitation for KM purposes in the Greek tourism industry by collecting empirical data from tourism professionals. The data was analysed by performing an utilisation–importance analysis that compared data measuring the actual utilisation of web 2.0 with the perceived utilisation importance of web 2.0 for KM purposes. The analysis identified several gaps and opportunities in relation to web 2.0 exploitation for KM purposes. The paper concludes by providing practical and theoretical implications for enhancing the exploitation of web 2.0 for KM purposes.,2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2013.05.032,"['Knowledge management', 'Web 2.0', 'Greece', 'Tourism', 'Social media', 'Utilisation–importance matrix']",Computers in Human Behavior,Investigating the exploitation of web 2.0 for knowledge management in the Greek tourism industry: An utilisation–importance analysis

The objective of the current research is to examine the factors which discriminate between Twitter brand followers’ decisions to engage in eWOM behaviors on the site. Specifically, this study proposes that peer communication, brand-related factors, and Twitter usage motivate brand followers to share eWOM messages on Twitter. Results from an online survey showed that brand followers who serve as role-models to others, those with positive attitudes toward and relationships with brands on Twitter, those who most heavily use Twitter and follow many brands, were most likely to tweet brands. Similar patterns were found in terms of retweeting the links of brands.

It seeks to investigate the effect of the key benefits generated from interacting with branded mobile apps on consumer satisfaction and purchase intentions. A self-administrated questionnaire was used to collect the study data. The questionnaire was distributed to 358 participants inside seven major malls in a Middle Eastern country (Jordan). Purposive sample was employed. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (AMOS 18). Four key findings emerged from the current research. First, the study confirms the existence of four interaction-based benefits in the context of mobile apps, namely: learning benefits, social integrative benefits, personal integrative benefits and hedonic benefits. Second, apart from social integrative benefits, the other three benefits are found to influence consumer satisfaction to varying degrees. Third, with regard to purchase intentions, only learning benefits and hedonic benefits are found to generate that. Finally, the study confirms the relationship between consumer satisfaction and purchase intentions in a mobile context.

Indeed, it is crucial to maintain BI systems and make them evolve in order to fit business and users’ needs. For this purpose, applying BI for BI is suggested. It helps to analyze the current BI environment and to make decisions about its use and evolution. Then, the main contribution of this paper consists in developing a novel system called BI4BI which is based on both BI systems’ data and BI users’ feedbacks.As a result, based on a user centered approach, an automated system for BI evaluation is developed helping its continuous evolution. To this end, system-based and user-based solutions provide two complementary data sources, required to effectively gather insights on the use of BI systems and the way they should evolve. A case study in a semiconductor manufacturer company demonstrates the impact of our solution on the evaluation and evolution of BI systems. Hence, thanks to the involvement of the company’s BI users during the solution design, a set of evaluation criteria responding to their objectives for evaluating the BI system are identified and validated. Furthermore, the results of this case study show that our proposed solution is better than existing ones, in terms of level of focus of its BI evaluation criteria, its level of automation, and its continuous processing.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2017.01.018,"['Business Intelligence', 'Design Science', 'Evaluation', 'Indicators', 'Evolution']",Expert Systems with Applications,BI4BI: A continuous evaluation system for Business Intelligence systems

It is based on an in-depth study of new high-tech small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and more established IT companies in Iran. We explore the process by which social media affordances interplay with forces of institutional entrepreneurship to create conditions for social change. More specifically we study the adoption in Iran of new business practices and models more commonly seen in other contexts, and relate this to the features of the platforms and the characteristics of a new generation of Iranian entrepreneurs. Drawing on institutional logics theory we conceptualize this process as one of transposition of logics in which dominant religious logics are challenged by market logics enabled by the mutual constitutional effects of human and material agencies. We suggest that three main mechanisms underpin this process: the discovery of practices from different institutional contexts, the appropriation of foreign practices, and the objectification of these practices. The study further contributes to the debate on the paradox of embedded agency and adds to the literature by providing a more integrated view of the role of social media in social change.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2014.06.008,"['Social media', 'Social change', 'Importation and transposition of logics', 'Institutional logics', 'Affordances']",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,Exploring the role of social media in importing logics across social contexts: The case of IT SMEs in Iran

However, successful adoption and implementation of this paradigm of managing business remains a challenge. In this article, we build a case for utilizing big data analytics (BDA) as a fundamental basis for informed and data driven decision making in supply chain networks supporting CE. We view this from a stakeholder perspective and argue that a collaborative association among all supply chain members can positively affect CE implementation. We propose a model highlighting the facilitating role of big data analytics for achieving shared sustainability goals. The model is based on integrating thematic categories coming out of 10 semi-structured interviews with key position holders in industry. We argue that mutual support and coordination driven by a stakeholder perspective coupled with holistic information processing and sharing along the entire supply chain network can effectively create a basis for achieving the triple bottom line of economic, ecological and social benefits. The proposed model is useful for managers in that it provides a reference point for aligning activities with the circular economy paradigm.

47,"Highlights•Community-engaging pages are positively associated with firm website visibility.•Study covers 2–3 thousand firms, millions of page downloads, and 5 years.•Results observed consistently over time despite a wide variety of controls.•Strong utility in predicting future website visibility with machine learning modelsWith an ever expanding content and user base, the Web presents information discovery and consumption challenges for both consumers and producers of information. Producers of information strive for visibility among consumers who have limited attention. Corporate websites are a primary digital marketing channel for firms through which they seek to gain a bigger share of their stakeholders' (i.e., customers, investors, communities) attention. Using observations spanning several years we study the website visibility, as measured by user traffic, of more than 2500 public firms and its association with properties of corporate websites and the corresponding firms. One property that is of particular interest to us is the availability of “community-engaging” pages, i.e., pages that support blogs or forums on the website or provide links to external social media platforms such as Facebook. These community-engaging pages signify online prosocial services provided by firms. We find that websites with larger number of community-engaging pages are associated with higher visibility. This provides a novel empirical support for the promotion and use of social media content and tools on websites of firms. We also find that websites with more specific content are associated with lower visibility while providing more out-links is associated with higher visibility. We observe these results consistently over time. These associations are observed while controlling for the size of the firms, types of their industries, the magnitude of media attention and other firm-level heterogeneity. Finally, machine learning models derived from our empirical analysis provide strong predictive utility for out-of-sample data.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2017.12.006,"['Online visibility', 'Social media', 'Web mining', 'Explanatory and predictive models']",Decision Support Systems,Visibility of corporate websites: The role of information prosociality
48,"Highlights•An investigation of the antecedents of disruptive technology continuous adoption and usage intentions post-adoption.•Efficiency-oriented motives and increased searching efforts improved continuous adoption intentions.•Normative pressures from supplying firms led to lower continuous adoption intentions.•Normative pressures were driven by interorganizational trust and mimetic pressures.•Firms adopting a disruptive technology should avoid over-reliance on trusted incumbent suppliers.This article focuses on the pre-adoption antecedents of disruptive technology continuous adoption intentions at the firm level. Understanding how to make a quality adoption decision, as measured by the firm's satisfaction and intention to continue using the technology after the initial adoption phase, is of critical importance for a buying manager. Given this challenge, a model for disruptive technology continuous adoption intention is proposed that considers the following: pre-adoption interorganizational trust, mimetic competitor pressures, normative supplier pressures, efficiency motives, searching efforts, and post-adoption satisfaction. This model was tested using survey results from 211 recent purchasing managers of a cloud computing service, an emerging disruptive technology. Interestingly, normative pressures from supplying firms prior to adoption led to lower user satisfaction and, consequently, lower intentions to continue adopting and using the technology. Moreover, these pressures were driven by pre-adoption levels of interorganizational trust and mimetic pressures from competitors. Potential adopting managers of a disruptive technology should instead be driven by efficiency-oriented motives and actually aim to increase their searching efforts in order to better understand the disruptive technology prior to adoption. These findings add to prior literature demonstrating the complex interplay of external pressures and internal motives on technology adoption strategies.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2017.01.003,"['Disruptive technology adoption', 'Normative supplier pressures', 'Interorganizational trust', 'Searching efforts', 'Efficiency motives', 'Continuous adoption intention']",Industrial Marketing Management,What drives post-adoption usage?

55,"Highlights•Thirty six selected community resilience assessment tools were analyzed.•Selected tools have taken diverse approaches to assess resilience.•A framework for evaluating performance of resilience assessment tools is proposed.•Environmental dimension is not adequately incorporated into the assessment tools.•Cross-scale relationships are largely neglected in the assessment process.The concept of resilience is increasingly used in academic and policy circles. To operationalize this concept and reduce the ambiguities surrounding it, since the turn of the century, various resilience assessment methodologies have been introduced. This paper provides a critical review of 36 selected community resilience assessment tools. These tools have been developed by a variety of entities, including national and local organizations, international donor organizations, and academic researchers. First, an overview of the selected tools is presented. This overview analysis shows that while some commonalities exist, there are also considerable differences between the tools. Next, based on literature review, an analytical framework is developed that identifies six criteria for evaluating performance of resilience assessment tools. These are, namely, addressing multiple dimensions of resilience, accounting for cross-scale relationships, capturing temporal dynamism, addressing uncertainties, employing participatory approaches, and developing action plans. Results show that limited success has been achieved in addressing these criteria. In terms of comprehensiveness, the environmental dimension has received relatively less attention in spite of its significance for building community resilience. Further improvements are needed to account for dynamics over time and across space. More attention to employing iterative processes that involve scenario-based planning is needed to better address challenges associated with uncertainties. Results also show that more attention needs to be paid to stakeholder participation in developing assessment tools. The paper concludes by highlighting several other areas of weakness that need to be addressed and discussing major challenges that still remain.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.05.023,"['Community resilience', 'Assessment tool', 'Measurement', 'Indicators', 'Criteria', 'Uncertainties']",Ecological Indicators,A critical review of selected tools for assessing community resilience

Our analysis of valence indicated that reading positive reviews can have a stronger effect on booking intentions among individuals who are strongly inclined toward conformity. In addition, a greater number of reviews proved to be more persuasive among individuals displaying a low degree of conformity.

Results fully support that during the service evaluation process, loyalty is predicted differently according to the individual's opinion leadership level. When opinion leadership is high, satisfaction-related attributes are determinant to predict a person's loyalty; when opinion leadership is low, perceived quality-related attributes act as predictors of loyalty.

ISRM field also needs information quality dimensions in order to ensure the information gathered for ISRM is considered of quality and can lead information security practitioners to make evidence-based decision.•	Information quality dimensions can ensure that an organization has a good level of information quality to support the information they gathered throughout the ISRM activities.Information security is becoming an important entity to most organizations due to current trends in information transfer through a borderless and vulnerable world. This gives more concerns and aware organization to apply information security risk management (ISRM) to develop effective and economically-viable control strategies. Even though there are numerous ISRM methods that are readily available, most of the ISRM methods prescribe a similar process that leads to establish a scope of the assessment, collecting information, producing intermediary information, and finally using the collected information to identify their security risks and provide a measured, analyzed security profile of critical information assets. Based on the “garbage in-garbage out” phenomenon, the success of ISRM planning tremendously depends on the quality of input information. However, with the amount, diversity and variety of information available, practitioners can easily deflects with grown information and becoming unmanageable. Therefore this paper contribute as a stepping stone to determine which IQ dimensions constitute the quality of the information throughout the process of gathering information during ISRM. Seems to accurately define the attributes of IQ dimensions, IQ needs to be assessed within the context of its generation. Thus, papers on IQ web were assessed and comparative analysis was conducted to identify the possible dimensions for ISRM. Then, online survey using likert structured questionnaire were distributed among a group of information security practitioners in Malaysia (N = 150). Partial least square (PLS) analysis revealed that dimension accuracy, amount of data, objective, completeness, reliability and verifiability are significantly influence the quality of information gathering for ISRM. These IQ dimensions can guide practitioners in the process of gathering quality and complete information in order to make a plan that leads to a clear direction, and ultimately help to make decisions that lead to success.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jisa.2017.07.004,"['Information security', 'Risk management', 'Information quality', 'Information Security Risk Management']",Journal of Information Security and Applications,Integrating information quality dimensions into information security risk management (ISRM)
63,"Highlights•Each additional year of schooling generates a return of 7.8% to 10.7% in hourly wage.•Migrant workers are discriminated against in urban China.•A significant gender gap exists in schooling returns, favoring male migrant workers.•Male and female migrant workers enjoy higher returns from attending polytechnic colleges and senior high schools, respectively.We examine schooling returns for migrant workers in China based on the 2009 Rural-Urban Migration in China (RUMiC) survey. Using a novel instrumental variable (IV) set based on the institutional environment unique to rural China, we find the point estimates of returns to lie within the range of 7.8%–10.7% for each additional year of schooling. Whilst our estimates are slightly higher than those reported for this cohort of workers in the literature, they are significantly lower than those enjoyed urban dwellers. Furthermore, we identify a wider gap in schooling returns between male (14.7%) and female (8.5%) migrant workers than the comparable gap for urban dwellers. Our results provide another line of evidence supporting a segmented labor market in urban China and remain robust to different estimators and under various IV restrictions. We suggest that improving the education system in the rural areas and eliminating the gender gap among migrant workers represent the necessary steps for enhancing social harmony in the Chinese society.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chieco.2017.09.008,"['J21', 'J31', 'J61', 'Schooling returns', 'Instrumental variables', 'Migrant workers', 'Gender gap', 'rural institutional environment']",China Economic Review,Schooling returns for migrant workers in China: Estimations from the perspective of the institutional environment in a rural setting
64,"Researchers seeking to study the relationships between consumers' communications, attitudes, and behaviors could benefit from monitoring consumers over time, across multiple locations and channels, and in a way that reflects consumers' subjective perceptions. Diaries on smartphones (mobile diaries) can be used as a research tool for such purposes. A mobile diary is a self-report instrument whereby people use their mobile handset to repeatedly report experiences of interest. Mobile diaries are increasingly used in psychology, geography, medicine, and commercial marketing. Yet they have rarely been used for quantitative marketing research, and were not benchmarked against best-practice metrics in marketing.In this study, we aim to set the ground for using mobile diaries in quantitative marketing research. We first lay out the theoretical infrastructure for the usage of mobile diaries, and describe possible respondent reporting concerns, including concerns related to non-reporting, reporting over time, and concerns stemming from individual-level heterogeneity.We demonstrate the potential of mobile diaries, as well as the importance of the various concerns, using a benchmark test case in the context of primetime TV viewing. Our benchmark uses a sample of respondents with both mobile diary viewing reports and Nielsen People Meter (NPM) records. Our analysis reveals that averaging across all conditions, 47.4%–64.7% of the NPM records are reported by the diary. The major sources for mismatch are random time periods without alarms, short viewings, and periodic reporting inactivity (pulsing). Concerns such as a decrease in reporting rates over time (e.g., fatigue), smartphone ownership, and demographic variation across individuals have relatively small effects on reporting likelihood. Analyzing the cases in which diary reports do not have a matching NPM record, we find many of them can be attributed to out-of-home viewing and viewing on non-metered devices. This finding demonstrates how mobile diaries can complement metered measurements. Overall, aggregate diary-based ratings have a 0.90 correlation with NPM ratings.We discuss implications for designing and using mobile diary studies in marketing.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijresmar.2018.01.002,"['Mobile diaries', 'Surveys', 'Survey validity', 'Self-reports', 'Longitudinal studies', 'Experience sampling method', 'Television viewing', 'Audience measurement', 'Nielsen People Meter', 'Survey errors']",International Journal of Research in Marketing,Mobile diaries – Benchmark against metered measurements: An empirical investigation
65,"Highlights•Socio-technical research of IT impact over five decades shows major evolution over time.•Dramatic lower transaction costs due to IT will make organizations source from outside.•Five different models of sourcing are described.•This leads to what is called Ambient Organizations.This contribution to the Ken D. Eason special issue is an illustration of the value of socio-technical analysis applied at an organizational level. We provide a brief historical overview of socio-technical IS research and review studies investigating the impact of IT on organizational structures in the last five decades, identifying a dominating (new) research theme in each decade. A key overall impact of IT in all decades has been a dramatic decrease in transaction costs making it increasingly easier for organizations to source from external providers. A five level taxonomy of sourcing arrangement is developed together with a framework of organizational activities, and a number of significant cases are offered of how organizations are sourcing practically all types of business processes, including innovation. We argue that future IT will further accelerate the movement towards more sourcing, eventually leading to a new type of organization that we call the Ambient organization.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2013.04.025,"['Information technology', 'Organizational design', 'Ambient Organization']",Applied Ergonomics,The impact of IT over five decades – Towards the Ambient Organization
66,"Highlights•Microfinance can be analyzed under Pareto's 80/20 Principle.•This paper presents a model to explain microfinance and mission drift.•The model has been tested with an international sample of microfinance institutions.•Mission centered MFI: small NGO, with labor productivity, donations and high margins.•The need for reducing interest rates is concluded, by using efficient technology.Poor people were excluded from financial services until microfinance institutions (MFIs) emerged. The mission of MFIs is to alleviate poverty, contributing to women empowerment, especially in rural communities. Microcredits can be analyzed under Pareto's 80/20 Principle. Their clients are situated in the long tail of the wealth distribution function. This niche market is not very attractive, because of its high administrative costs, lack of deposits and the need for compensating low revenues with fluctuating subsidies. Some MFIs have drifted from their mission. This paper presents a model to explain microfinance mission drift, tested with hypotheses. The results from the empirical study show a pattern of mission centered MFI: a small NGO, with labor productivity, receiving donations and obtaining a high yield. It can be concluded that there is a need for reducing interest rates.

67,"A common strategy of producers to cope with increasing competition is to involve users in their business processes. User integration happens, among other reasons, because producers seek knowledge about product usage. In order to access this knowledge, a plethora of approaches and methods can be applied. Many of these are discussed in different but related domains, such as Open Innovation and Design Thinking. The goal of this paper is to start an investigation of these different approaches and structure them according to a single context. This single context is provided by a model describing the sharing of knowledge between user and producer. In this paper, the sharing is based on the mutual exchange information. Knowledge sharing is facilitated by two strategies: user integration and producer integration. Paradigms such as mass production, mass customization and servitization are put into the context of the model. Within the discussion, more specific approaches like Social Media exploitation, Product Embedded Information Devices, Design for X, product takeback and product services are structured according to the proposed model and the two strategies. The conclusion of this paper names open questions, such as the role of information quality and rewarding users for sharing their information with producers.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2016.04.193,"['communication', 'product information', 'user integration', 'product design', 'mass customization']",Procedia CIRP,Approach to Describe Knowledge Sharing between Producer and User
68,"Highlights•Social media is used as a platform for marketing and advertising activities.•Firms always find a challenge to design social media ads to attract customers.•This study aims to test social media ads factors affecting purchase intention.•The conceptual model was proposed based on the UTAUT2 and other factors.•The UTAUT2 factors, interactivity, informativeness, and relevance are supported.Social media is being increasingly used as a platform to conduct marketing and advertising activities. Organizations have spent a lot of time, money, and resources on social media ads. However, there is always a challenge in how organizations can design social media advertising to successfully attract customers and motivate them to purchase their brands. Thus, this study aims to identify and test the main factors related to social media advertising that could predict purchase intention. The conceptual model was proposed based on three factors from the extending Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) (performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, and habit) along with interactivity, informativeness, and perceived relevance. The data was collected using a questionnaire survey of 437 participants. The key results of structural equation modelling (SEM) largely supported the current model’s validity and the significant impact of performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, interactivity, informativeness, and perceived relevance on purchase intentions. This study will hopefully provide a number of theoretical and practical guidelines on how marketers can effectively plan and implement their ads over social media platforms.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2018.06.001,"['Social media', 'Marketing', 'Advertising', 'Customers', 'Purchase intention']",International Journal of Information Management,Investigating the impact of social media advertising features on customer purchase intention
69,"Over the last few years, we have encountered an exponential growth in online communication opportunities. Organizations have more and more ways to connect and engage with their current or future customers. The existence of more opportunities in connecting to people can be both an enabler and a burden. Being present at a multitude of different channels requires the effective management of a very large number of adapted contents, formats, and interaction patterns fulfilling the communication and cooperation needs of distributed target groups. In this respect, we integrate existing fragmented communication and monitoring approaches into a full-fledged communication model as a basis for an adequate engagement approach. We describe applications of our approach in both the eTourism and manufacturing domain. In this paper, we introduce an approach that will enable communication, collaboration and value exchange of users through a multitude of online interaction possibilities based on the use of semantic technology.

70,"Technologies transform tourism management and marketing from a static and utilitarian sense (whereby managers and tourists use technologies as tools) to a transformative conceptualization whereby tourism markets and actors both shape and are shaped by technology. This paper unravels the transformative power of technologies on: the tourism actors and resources (both the traditional but also new actors, i.e. the technology agents); the ways actors interact to (co-)create but also (co-)destruct tourism value; and the context in which tourism actors interact from a linear supply chain tourism ‘industry’ to a complex socio-technical smart tourism ecosystem. To study such complex phenomena and transformations, the paper emphasises that research should not only adopt a multi-disciplinary approach, but it also needs to follow an anti-disciplinary thinking whereby new knowledge and constructs do not simply fall within existing paradigms, disciplinary silos and mindsets once developed by studying the ‘pure’ humans and their behaviours.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmp.2017.12.003,[],Tourism Management Perspectives,New technologies in tourism: From multi-disciplinary to anti-disciplinary advances and trajectories
71,"Asia's emerging markets are poised for explosive digital growth. With the rapid adoption of the Internet and the familiarisation of consumers with mobile devices, the mobile commerce market is set to become one of the most promising and lucrative growth markets. In Malaysia, although the mobile commerce market is relatively at its infancy stage, the mobile internet penetration is expected to grow rapidly in years to come. Numerous mobile commerce adoption studies have been investigated. However, little attention has been paid on what factors could be utilised to retain mobile commerce customers, which could in turn improve business performance. Therefore, this paper aims to bridge the gap by investigating the factors that affect mobile commerce customer loyalty in Malaysia by incorporating e-service quality models and relationship quality theories in the context of mobile commerce. Specifically, the objective of this study is to examine the relationships between e-service quality dimensions of efficiency, system availability, fulfilment and privacy, and relationship quality dimensions of satisfaction, trust and commitment with customer loyalty in mobile commerce services. Online survey method was used for data collection. Out of the 300 questionnaires distributed, 214 were completed and returned, yielding a response rate of 71.3 percent. Data were subsequently analysed using the Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) method. The research findings contributed significantly in filling up the knowledge gap regarding the determinants of customer loyalty in mobile commerce services.

It helps organizations to concentrate on high rank solutions and develop strategies to implement them on priority. This paper proposes a framework based on fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to identify and rank the solutions of KM adoption in SC and overcome its barriers. The AHP is used to determine weights of the barriers as criteria, and fuzzy TOPSIS method is used to obtain final ranking of the solutions of KM adoption in SC. The empirical case study analysis of an Indian hydraulic valve manufacturing organization is conducted to illustrate the use of the proposed framework for ranking the solutions of KM adoption in SC to overcome its barriers.

73,"Highlights•Offering a systematic overview of the knowledge sharing mechanisms in the project teams.•Offering a summary of the selected articles.•Exploring some primary challenges in the field of the knowledge sharing in project teams.•Presenting the guidelines to face the existing challenges.•Outlining the key areas to improve the function of knowledge sharing in project teams.Knowledge management is the process of capturing, sharing, developing, and using the knowledge efficiently. Knowledge sharing as one of the important parts of the knowledge management system means that an individual, team, and the organization share the knowledge with other members in the form of activities through the various ways. On the other hand, a project team is a team whose members usually belongs to different departments and are assigned to join the same project. In a project team, knowledge sharing is very important because it provides a link between the member and the project team by sharing knowledge to reduce cost and increase the performance. However, despite the importance of the knowledge sharing mechanisms and techniques in the project teams, to the best of our knowledge, the comprehensive and systematic research and study about the antecedents and backgrounds of knowledge sharing mechanisms between project teams is rare. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to provide the comprehensive and detailed review of the state-of-the-art knowledge sharing mechanisms in the project team as well as directions for future research. Also, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on the knowledge sharing mechanisms in project teams up to the end of 2015. We identified 71 papers, which are reduced to 28 primary studies through our paper selection process.

74,"Identity theft, fraud, and abuse are problems affecting the entire society. Identity theft is often a “gateway” crime, as criminals use stolen or fraudulent identities to steal money, claim eligibility for services, hack into networks without authorization, and so on. The available data describing identity crimes and their aftermath are often in the form of recorded stories and reports by the news press, fraud examiners, and law enforcement. All of these sources are unstructured. In order to analyze identity theft data, this research proposes an approach which involves the novel collection of online news stories and reports on the topic of identity theft. Our approach pre-processes the raw text and extracts semi-structured information automatically, using text mining techniques. This paper presents statistical analysis of behavioral patterns and resources used by thieves and fraudsters to commit identity theft, including the identity attributes commonly linked to identity crimes, resources thieves employ to conduct identity crimes, and temporal patterns of criminal behavior. Furthermore, the automatically extracted information is validated against manually investigated news stories. Analyses of these results increase empirical understanding of identity threat behaviors, offer early warning signs of identity theft, and thwart future identity theft crimes.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2016.11.002,"['Identity theft', 'Text mining', 'News stories', 'PII attributes', 'Named entity recognition']",Computers & Security,Modeling and analysis of identity threat behaviors through text mining of identity theft stories

No effect of calculative trust.•Only affective trust leads directly to greater investment in the relationship, and also generates additional confidential communication.This research tests a multistage model of trust in business-to-business (B2B) relationships. The model contains three forms of trust, each with unique drivers and consequences for buyer–supplier relationships. An exploratory qualitative study (N = 38) and four quantitative studies (NTotal = 616) validate the distinct stages (N1 = 140, N2 = 144, N3 = 152) and provide an overall test of the model (N4 = 180), using structural equation modeling techniques. The results support the proposed modeling of the stages and highlight a positive effect of reputation on calculative trust. Conflict resolution, communication, and sympathy positively affect cognitive trust. However, shared values do not significantly drive affective trust. Interdependence also exists among the three trust forms, both directly and indirectly. That is, calculative trust does not affect investments in relationship or confidential communication, but cognitive trust influences these constructs indirectly, through the mediation of affective trust. Affective trust also leads directly to greater investments in relationship and generates additional confidential communication.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2017.08.003,"['Trust process', 'Affective trust', 'Cognitive trust', 'Calculative trust', 'Multistage approach', 'Buyer–supplier relationships']",Industrial Marketing Management,Fundamental transformations of trust and its drivers: A multi-stage approach of business-to-business relationships

In this study, we review the literature on data envelopment analysis (DEA) applications in sustainability using citation-based approaches. A directional network is constructed based on citation relationships among DEA papers published in journals indexed by the Web of Science database from 1996 to March 2016. We first draw the citation chronological graph to present a complete picture of literature development trajectory since 1996. Then we identify the local main DEA development paths in sustainability research by assigning an importance index, namely search path count (SPC), to each link in the citation network. The local main path suggests that the current key route of DEA applications in sustainability focus on the environmental sustainability. Through the Kamada–Kawai layout algorithm, we find four research clusters in the literature including corporate sustainability assessment, regional sustainability assessment, sustainability composite indicator construction, and sustainability performance analysis. For each of the clusters, we further identify the key articles based on citation network and local citation scores, demonstrate the developmental trajectory of the literature, and suggest future research directions.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2017.06.023,"['Data envelopment analysis (DEA)', 'Sustainability', 'Literature survey', 'Citation analysis']",European Journal of Operational Research,"Data envelopment analysis application in sustainability: The origins, development and future directions"
77,"Highlights•This study reflects considerable variation in Latino migrant workers use of alcohol.•A sizeable proportion of Latino migrant workers engage in frequent heavy drinking.•We found important differences in drinking patterns across gender.BackgroundA significant segment of the Latino migrant worker population in the United States is at high risk for alcohol abuse and related risk behaviors. Information about the prevalence of alcohol use and abuse and its association with sociodemographic and psychological variables is needed for designing effective intervention prevention strategies.MethodsCross-sectional data were drawn from a baseline assessment that was part of a randomized controlled trial of 278 Latino migrant workers (LMWs) conducted between 2008 and 2010.ResultsAbout one-third (32%) of participants engaged in heavy drinking in the past 30 days prior to baseline interview. More females than males reported no alcohol use in the past 30 days (53.5% vs. 20.5%). On the other hand, more males reported drinking every day or nearly (25.2% vs. 7.1%). Five factors—gender, country of origin, relationship status, living arrangements, and acculturation—were significantly associated with frequency of alcohol consumption. Multivariate analyses indicated that gender, country of origin, education attainment, relationship status, living arrangement, living with children, length of stay in the US, religious beliefs, acculturation, and depression were associated with frequent heavy drinking, alcohol abuse/dependence, and unprotected sex under the influence of alcohol.ConclusionsThere is significant variation in alcohol use among Latino migrant workers. Although a substantial proportion of this population abstains from alcohol, an equally substantial proportion report levels of alcohol use that pose significant risk. More research is needed to better understand drinking patters in this community in order to design prevention strategies specifically tailored for this population.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.03.025,"['Alcohol use and abuse', 'Prevention', 'Latinos', 'Migrant workers']",Drug and Alcohol Dependence,Alcohol use among Latino migrant workers in South Florida

In this paper, we propose a label propagation framework based on Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA), which builds a latent semantic space where correlation of visual and textual features are well preserved into a semantic embedding. The proposed approach is robust and can work either when the training set is well annotated by experts, as well as when it is noisy such as in the case of user-generated tags in social media. We report extensive results on four popular datasets. Our results show that our KCCA-based framework can be applied to several state-of-the-art label transfer methods to obtain significant improvements.

Examination of these theories reveals three main concerns. First, the theories mostly “black box” (or omit) the IT artifact. Second, appropriate mid-range theory is not developed to contribute to disciplinary progress and to serve the needs of our practitioner community. Third, theories are overlapping but incommensurable.

Egg donors undergo the same medical regimen for a different reason – to produce eggs for another woman in exchange for thousands of dollars – and describe it as quick and relatively painless. Medical researchers typically compare bodily responses by variables such as gender, age, and health status. We use the case of “egg production” to propose a new factor that may be an important source of variation in bodily experience: an individual's reason for undergoing the medical intervention in the first place. Using cluster analysis to analyze an original survey of 50 IVF patients and 62 egg donors from the United States, we find two distinct kinds of bodily experiences – “less intense” and “more intense” – and the intensity of one's experience is associated with one's reason for producing eggs: either to become pregnant or to donate them for money.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.06.027,"['Bodily experience', 'Mind/body', 'Embodiment', 'Reproductive technology', 'In\xa0vitro fertilization (IVF)', 'Egg donation', 'Survey', 'Cluster analysis']",Social Science & Medicine,"Same medicine, different reasons: Comparing women's bodily experiences of producing eggs for pregnancy or for profit"
86,"Extant streams of literature on technology sourcing, website personalization and social media marketing are distinct from one another and hence are unable to explain the impact of technology sourcing for website personalization and social media marketing on sales. To address this gap, we use various concepts such as efficiency, adaptability, risks of dependency, lack of quality control, asset-specificity and tacit knowledge to hypothesize the direct effect of technology sourcing on sales as well as the indirect effect through social media performance. Using survey data from 105 U.S. e-retailers, we show that e-retailers using mixed technology sourcing for website personalization have greater sales than e-retailers that use either internally or externally developed technology. On the contrary, e-retailers selecting externally developed technology for social media marketing have greater sales than e-retailers that offer social media marketing that uses either internally developed technology or mixed technology sourcing.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2017.06.005,"['Technology sourcing', 'Website personalization', 'Social media marketing', 'Market performance']",Journal of Business Research,Technology sourcing for website personalization and social media marketing: A study of e-retailing industry

Organizations in these environments have to be agile in order to adapt their strategies and actions to be successful. While it is recognized that information technology can enable firms to be agile, there is a limited understanding of the mechanisms through and the contexts in which Information Technology (IT) enhances agility. This study examines two key antecedents of organizational agility, namely the IT competence of a firm and its innovation capacity and, examine their independent and joint effects on agility. We test our model using data collected from large firms in the US. The results provide strong support for our model. We found that firms with superior IS capabilities coupled with an aggressive IT investment orientation create digital platforms that enable them to be agile. We also found that the innovation capacity of the firm has a positive relationship with organizational agility and that firms with higher innovation capacity are better able to leverage their digital platforms to enhance agility. Our results indicate that organizational agility has a strong positive impact of firm performance.

This study advances our knowledge by developing an innovative model for exploring the impact of knowledge sharing on SPI success, the impact of knowledge sharing in specific organizational cultures, and how the support of top management specifically influences the path to SPI success. To empirically test the model, this study adopts the statistical technique of partial least squares (PLS) to analyze 118 samples collected from SPI-certified Taiwanese organizations. The results suggest that clan-type organizational culture has a stronger association with knowledge sharing than hierarchy-type in the context of SPI success. SPI knowledge sharing is found to be a mediator of both clan culture and top management support in the context of SPI success. The findings also include the implication to improve our knowledge about how organizational culture and top management support drive effective knowledge sharing on the way to SPI success.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2015.08.030,"['Software process improvement (SPI)', 'Knowledge sharing', 'Organizational culture', 'Top management support', 'SPI success']",Computers in Human Behavior,Examining the impacts of organizational culture and top management support of knowledge sharing on the success of software process improvement

0,"Essential criteria for the methodological quality and validity of randomized controlled trials are the drop-out rates from both the experimental intervention and the study as a whole. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed these drop-out rates in non-pharmacological schizophrenia trials. A systematic literature search was used to identify relevant trials with ≥100 sample size and to extract the drop-out data. The rates of drop-out from the experimental intervention and study were calculated with meta-analysis of proportions. Meta-regression was applied to explore the association between the study and sample characteristics and the drop-out rates. 43 RCTs were found, with drop-out from intervention ranging from 0% to 63% and study drop-out ranging from 4% to 71%. Meta-analyses of proportions showed an overall drop-out rate of 14% (95% CI: 13–15%) at the experimental intervention level and 20% (95% CI: 17–24%) at the study level. Meta-regression showed that the active intervention drop-out rates were predicted by the number of intervention sessions. In non-pharmacological schizophrenia trials, drop-out rates of less than 20% can be achieved for both the study and the experimental intervention.

Although caregiving is intended to contribute to the care recipient's health, its effects on the health of older European caregivers are not yet clear. This study explores the association between providing informal personal care and the caregivers' health.MethodData were used from the longitudinal cohort (2004/2005–2010/2011) of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) (n = 7858). Generalized estimating equations were used to explore the longitudinal association of informal care and the caregiver's health using poor self-rated health (less than good), poor mental health (EURO-D score for depression ≥ 4), and poor physical health (≥ 2 health complaints).ResultsProviding informal personal care was significantly associated with poor mental health (OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.04–1.47) and poor physical health (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.01–1.38), after adjusting for various socio-demographic and health-related factors. No statistical significant association was found for self-rated health in the adjusted models.ConclusionProviding informal personal care may negatively influence the caregiver's mental and physical health.

The Naivasha-Nakuru Basin in Kenya's Rift Valley is a region that is not only highly sensitive to climatic changes but also one of the world's most obsidian-rich landscapes. We used portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) analyses of obsidian artifacts and geological specimens to understand patterns of toolstone acquisition and consumption reflected in the early/middle Holocene strata (Phases 3–4 of the Eburran industry) at Gamble's Cave II. Our analyses represent the first geochemical source identifications of obsidian artifacts from the Eburran industry and indicate the persistent selection over time for high-quality obsidian from Mt. Eburru, ~20 km distant, despite changes in site occupation intensity that apparently correlate with changes in the local environment. This result may indicate resilience of Eburran foraging strategies during environmental shifts and, potentially, a cultural preference for a specific lithic material that overcame its accessibility changes. Testing such hypotheses requires a more extensive program of obsidian artifact sourcing.

8,"Highlights•Administrative records from a 311 system and a survey of 311 users were linked.•Motivations for reporting public incivilities (i.e., graffiti) were tested.•Such reports were associated with territorial motivations to enforce social norms.•This distinguishes them from reports of natural deterioration or personal needs.•This illustrates how “small” data can provide interpretive meaning to “big” data.Informal social control is considered a vital component of the well-being of urban communities. Though some argue that the actions that constitute this social process are often said to reflect territoriality, little else is known about how individuals contribute to it. The current study leverages a database of over 600,000 requests for government services received by the city of Boston, MA's 311 system as a way to answer such questions, focusing particularly on reports of issues in the public space arising from incivilities. In order to establish construct validity for the “big data” of the 311 system, they are combined with the “small data” of a survey of 311 users, permitting the simultaneous analysis of objective reporting behaviors with self-report attitudes. The analysis occurs in two parts. First, reporting of incivilities is distinguished behaviorally from reporting public issues arising from natural deterioration, and people are found to specialize in one or the other. Second, the survey is used to test whether the reports are a reflection of territoriality. Reports of incivilities were unique in their association with a desire to enforce local social norms. They were also associated with a second territorial motivation to benefit the community. Implications for future research are discussed.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2016.04.009,"['Disorder', '311 systems', 'Computational social science', 'Broken windows']",Social Science Research,Using small data to interpret big data: 311 reports as individual contributions to informal social control in urban neighborhoods
9,"Customer Churn Prediction (CCP) is a challenging activity for decision makers and machine learning community because most of the time, churn and non-churn customers have resembling features. From different experiments on customer churn and related data, it can be seen that a classifier shows different accuracy levels for different zones of a dataset. In such situations, a correlation can easily be observed in the level of classifier's accuracy and certainty of its prediction. If a mechanism can be defined to estimate the classifier's certainty for different zones within the data, then the expected classifier's accuracy can be estimated even before the classification. In this paper, a novel CCP approach is presented based on the above concept of classifier's certainty estimation using distance factor. The dataset is grouped into different zones based on the distance factor which are then divided into two categories as; (i) data with high certainty, and (ii) data with low certainty, for predicting customers exhibiting Churn and Non-churn behavior. Using different state-of-the-art evaluation measures (e.g., accuracy, f-measure, precision and recall) on different publicly available the Telecommunication Industry (TCI) datasets show that (i) the distance factor is strongly co-related with the certainty of the classifier, and (ii) the classifier obtained high accuracy in the zone with greater distance factor's value (i.e., customer churn and non-churn with high certainty) than those placed in the zone with smaller distance factor's value (i.e., customer churn and non-churn with low certainty).",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.03.003,"['Churn prediction', 'Uncertain samples', 'Classification', 'Telecommunication', 'Customer churn']",Journal of Business Research,Customer churn prediction in telecommunication industry using data certainty
10,"Highlights•We examined the effectiveness an optimized cluster-based undersampling technique.•We used a GA-based optimization approach for selecting the appropriate instances.•A critical issue of real-world knowledge extraction is the data imbalance problem.•The proposed method is successfully applied to the bankruptcy prediction problem.We suggest an optimization approach of cluster-based undersampling to select appropriate instances. This approach can solve the data imbalance problem, which can lead to knowledge extraction for improving the performance of existing data mining techniques. Although data mining techniques among various big data analytics technologies have been successfully applied and proven in terms of classification performance in various domains, such as marketing, accounting and finance areas, the data imbalance problem has been regarded as one of the most important issues to be considered.We examined the effectiveness of a hybrid method using a clustering technique and genetic algorithms based on the artificial neural networks model to balance the proportion between the minority class and majority class. The objective of this paper is to constitute the best suitable training dataset for both decreasing data imbalance and improving the classification accuracy. We extracted the properly balanced dataset composed of optimal or near-optimal instances for the artificial neural networks model. The main contribution of the proposed method is that we extract explorative knowledge based on recognition of the data structure and categorize instances through the clustering technique while performing simultaneous optimization for the artificial neural networks modeling. In addition, we can easily understand why the instances are selected by the rule-format knowledge representation increasing the expressive power of the criteria of selecting instances. The proposed method is successfully applied to the bankruptcy prediction problem using financial data for which the proportion of small- and medium-sized bankruptcy firms in the manufacturing industry is extremely small compared to that of non-bankruptcy firms.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2016.04.027,"['Genetic algorithms', 'Cluster-based undersampling technique', 'Imbalance data', 'Corporate bankruptcy prediction']",Expert Systems with Applications,Optimization of cluster-based evolutionary undersampling for the artificial neural networks in corporate bankruptcy prediction

12,"PurposeTo develop and pilot a theory-based, mobile phone texting component attractive to minority youth as a supplement to the Teen Outreach Program®, a youth development program for reducing teen pregnancy and school dropout.MethodsWe conducted iterative formative research with minority youth in multiple focus groups to explore interest in texting and reaction to text messages. We piloted a month-long version of TOP® Plus Text with 96 teens at four sites and conducted a computer-based survey immediately after enrollment and at the end of the pilot that collected information about teens' values, social support, self-efficacy, and behaviors relating to school performance, trouble with the law, and sexual activity. After each of the first three weekly sessions we collected satisfaction measures. Upon completion of the pilot we conducted exit interviews with twelve purposively selected pilot participants.ResultsWe successfully recruited and enrolled minority youth into the pilot. Teens were enthusiastic about text messages complementing TOP®. Results also revealed barriers: access to text-capable mobile phones, retention as measured by completion of the post-pilot survey, and a need to be attentive to teen literacy.ConclusionsPiloting helped identify improvements for implementation including offering text messages through multiple platforms so youth without access to a mobile phone could receive messages; rewording texts to allow youth to express opinions without feeling judged; and collecting multiple types of contact information to improve follow-up. Thoughtful attention to social and behavioral theory and investment in iterative formative research with extensive consultation with teens can lead to an engaging texting curriculum that enhances and complements TOP®.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2013.12.005,"['Teen pregnancy', 'Text messaging', 'Health communication', 'Iterative formative research', 'Adaptation']",Journal of Adolescent Health,Enhancing a Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program With Text Messaging: Engaging Minority Youth to Develop TOP® Plus Text

14,"Highlights•Correlation analysis is proposed to select key metrics representing others.•PCA is proposed to characterize running status and predict the possibility of faults.•We dynamically adjust metrics and periods based on a reliability model.•We evaluate the approach on our real cloud platform with case studies.Monitoring is the key to guarantee the reliability of cloud computing systems. By analyzing monitoring data, administrators can understand systems’ statuses to detect, diagnose and solve problems. However, due to the enormous scale and complex structure of cloud computing, a monitoring system should collect, transfer, store and process a large amount of monitoring data, which brings a significant performance overhead and increases the difficulty of analyzing useful information. To address the above issue, this paper proposes a self-adaptive monitoring approach for cloud computing systems. First, we conduct correlation analysis between different metrics, and monitor selected important ones which represent the others and reflect the running status of a system. Second, we characterize the running status with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), estimate the anomaly degree, and predict the possibility of faults. Finally, we dynamically adjust the monitoring period based on the estimated anomaly degree and a reliability model. To evaluate our proposal, we have applied the approach in our open-source TPC-W benchmark Bench4Q deployed in our real cloud computing platform OnceCloud. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can adapt to dynamic workloads, accurately estimate the anomaly degree, and automatically adjust monitoring periods. Thus, the approach can effectively improve the accuracy and timeliness of anomaly detection in an abnormal status, and efficiently lower the monitoring overhead in a normal status.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2017.09.067,"['Cloud computing', 'Anomaly detection', 'Adaptive monitoring', 'Correlation analysis']",Future Generation Computer Systems,Self-adaptive cloud monitoring with online anomaly detection

We have focused on those images where number of objects as a result of forgery, gets increased. We performed connected component analysis before block matching to reduce time complexity and for more reliable results. The fraudster attempts to make its appearance more like original.

The “social features” of this software type have stimulated a renewed interest in Enterprise Collaboration Systems (ECS). In this paper we present findings from a longitudinal research project on the introduction and use of ECS in companies. We argue that ERP Systems and ECS are inherently different and that the process-paradigm that is common to ERP cannot be applied identically to ECS. To address this issue, we developed and tested the IRESS framework which supports companies in their requirements analysis for ECS projects. From the literature and 14 case studies we identified typical use cases and collaboration scenarios that can serve as blueprints for ECS introduction projects.

On one hand, it presents opportunity for manufacturers and sellers to be highlighted for their good work, but at the same time, there remains a possibility of negative review impacting goodwill and reputation. Hence, it is important for managers to identify factors that impact consumers’ intentions to write online reviews. This research delves into this aspect by trying to identify the factors that impact reviews writing intentions of consumers for restaurants. The study extends the theory of planned behaviour with additions of variables such as ego involvement, taking vengeance and helping a restaurant. For this, 252 valid responses were obtained, and structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed model. Results indicate that perceived behavioural control, subjective norms, ego involvement and taking vengeance are significant predictors of intention to write online reviews for the restaurants.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jretconser.2017.10.001,"['Intentions to write online reviews', 'Consumer behaviour', 'Theory of planned behaviour', 'E-WOM']",Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,An integrated model for predicting consumer's intention to write online reviews

These sources of massive data usually overwhelm them, because they are not able to consume that amount of data. Task Automation Services (TASs) are platforms or apps that allow their users to author automation rules to combine events from streams while reducing the effort for handling incoming information. While these platforms are a reality, they suffer from two major drawbacks: (i) the only incoming data streams available are those the TASs developers decided to include in the system, and (ii) they lack of a mechanism to reason over large scale data outside their platform. To face these challenges, this paper contributes in (i) reviewing the existing state of the art including research and commercial work given their relevance. Based on the lessons learnt from this review, (ii) we propose the Evented WEb ontology (EWE), that models the Evented WEb domain, and in particular those concepts around TASs. EWE enables scalability, interoperability and definition of rules with reasoning over Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud. To illustrate these contributions, (iii) a semantic TAS has been implemented that benefits from the advantages EWE offers, and solves a realistic problem using semantic technologies.

23,"Highlights•Hotels on multiple OTAs are beneficial in terms of revenue growth.•Hotels on multiple OTAs are beneficial in terms of operating profitability.•Hotels on multiple OTAs have better profitability than being on TripAdvisor.•Hoteliers should know where to put resources for capturing value.•Results help to study industry architecture changes for experience goods.Infomediaries such as online travel agencies (OTAs) and review aggregator websites are profoundly changing the structure of the hospitality industry with consequences in the mechanisms of creation and capture of economic value for hotels. By drawing on arguments from resource-based views, transaction cost economics and industrial organisations, we look inside these mechanisms by assessing whether in regard to creation and capture of economic value hotels should pay more attention to diversify the number of OTAs that distribute their services or to improve their reputation through travellers’ reviews posted on TripAdvisor. Gathering data on 62,865 travellers’ reviews on TripAdvisor and on the presence of hotels on multiple OTAs, we built a panel dataset of 355 hotels spanning from 2004 to 2014 and also including hotels’ financial data. Fixed effects regression models show that hotels listed on multiple OTA bolster sales revenue and operating profitability. We demonstrated that for hotels, the online visibility on OTAs counts more on value capture than the online reputation gained on TripAdvisor. Through the presence on multiple OTAs, hotels are expected to have a higher bargaining power towards each individual distributor. We discuss the implications of these results on the way hotels, OTAs and TripAdvisor can generate and capture value in the vertical chain of the travel industry.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.im.2016.12.002,"['Value creation', 'Value capture', 'OTAs', 'Hotels', 'Online customer reviews']",Information & Management,How small hotels can drive value their way in infomediation.

The result shows that customer value was influenced by customer satisfaction and service innovation. This study conducted analysis on innovative services such as self-check-in kiosk, X-ray, social media communication, and micro-hotels in an airport. Result indicates all four services revealed a positive moderation effect. The security check was the most important evaluation factor in an airport service.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2015.05.010,"['Customer satisfaction (CS)', 'Customer value (CV)', 'Airport service', 'Service innovation (SI)']",Technology in Society,Services innovation impact to customer satisfaction and customer value enhancement in airport
36,"Highlights•Customer engagement has been conceptually reviewed and empirically examined.•This study probed the different dimensions of customer engagement in online games.•Both psychological and behavioral engagement were positively associated with online sales.•Three factors together explained 65% of the variance in psychological engagement.With keen competition in the online game industry, game developers and publishers are finding new ways to induce players’ to spend money on subscriptions and virtual items. As the online game itself provides a highly engaging environment, this study examines online sales from the perspective of customer engagement. We propose a research model that examines why game players actively engage in playing online games, and how such engagement can contribute to sales of online games, empirically testing the model using 377 online game players. The results support our research hypotheses and illustrate the effect of customer psychological engagement on stimulating game players’ spending in online games. In particular, both psychological and behavioral engagement exerted a positive influence on online sales, and the dimensions and antecedents of psychological engagement were also identified. The findings of this study are expected to provide some suggestions for game developers and publishers on promoting the sales of digital items/goods. This study also adds to the current understanding of customer psychological engagement by identifying its antecedents and consequences in the context of online games.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.elerap.2015.03.001,"['Customer engagement', 'Online sales', 'Virtual world', 'Online games', 'Customer satisfaction']",Electronic Commerce Research and Applications,Promoting sales of online games through customer engagement
37,"This is a report from the field on a linguistic-based relevance technology based on learning of parse trees for processing, classification and delivery of a stream of texts. We describe the content pipeline for eBay entertainment domain which employs this technology, and show that text processing relevance is the main bottleneck for its performance. A number of components of the content pipeline such as content mining, aggregation, deduplication, opinion mining, integrity enforcing need to rely on domain-independent efficient text classification, entity extraction and relevance assessment operations.Text relevance assessment is based on the operation of syntactic generalization (SG) which finds a maximum common sub-tree for a pair of parse trees for sentences. Relevance of two portions of texts is then defined as a cardinality of this sub-tree. SG is intended to substitute keyword-based analysis for more accurate assessment of relevance which takes phrase-level and sentence-level information into account. In the partial case where short expression are commonly used terms such as Facebook likes, SG ascends to the level of categories and a reasoning technique is required to map these categories in the course of relevance assessment.A number of content pipeline components employ web mining which needs SG to compare web search results. We describe how SG works in a number of components in the content pipeline including personalization and recommendation, and provide the evaluation results for eBay deployment.

40,"Highlights•Brand loyalty is strongly related to offline word of mouth (in-person WOM) but much less so to online word of mouth (eWOM).•Self-brand connection motivates brand loyal consumers to engage in eWOM.•Brands can motivate loyal consumers to spread eWOM by making them aware that online brand support is helpful for the brand•Heavier users of online media are more inclined to engage in eWOM.Marketers increasingly seek to build brand advocacy not only via traditional word of mouth (in-person WOM) but also by engaging their (loyal) customers via online media (eWOM). In a survey and three follow-up experiments, however, we show that brand loyalty is less positively related to spreading eWOM than in-person WOM (Studies 1–3). We find that loyal consumers' willingness to engage in eWOM increases when they are motivated to signal their identity through a brand (i.e., high self-brand connection in Studies 1–3) or to help a brand (Study 4). Our findings support the notion that online communication spreads faster and is less spontaneous and more deliberate than face-to-face communication. In turn, loyal consumers need strong motivation tied to the brand to engage in eWOM.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijresmar.2017.08.002,"['Loyalty', 'Branding', '(Electronic) word of mouth', 'Self-brand connection', 'Social media']",International Journal of Research in Marketing,The differential impact of brand loyalty on traditional and online word of mouth: The moderating roles of self-brand connection and the desire to help the brand

43,"This article examines the impact of various individual differences on consumers' propensity to engage in two distinct forms of conspicuous (publicly observable) luxury consumption behavior. Status seeking is an established driver, but other managerially relevant drivers can also explain conspicuous consumption of luxuries. The study develops and empirically confirms a conceptual model that shows that bandwagon and snobbish buying patterns underlie the more generic conspicuous consumption of luxuries. In addition to status seeking, the self-concept orientation regulates which of these two patterns is more prominent. Both susceptibility to normative influence and need for uniqueness mediate the influence of self-concept. The modeled psychological constructs explain a large part of the variance in conspicuous luxury consumption patterns and can be used as input in the development of marketing strategies.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2014.04.024,"['Conspicuous consumption', 'Luxury', 'Self-concept', 'Status', 'Bandwagon and snob effects']",Journal of Business Research,Explaining variation in conspicuous luxury consumption: An individual differences' perspective

It engages with the incremental, and contested, introduction of the lantern and lantern slides into the meetings of the RGS. The paper first assesses approaches to the magic lantern adopted by historical geographers. It then explores the close connections between the uptake of the technology at the RGS and contemporary geographical societies in Britain and France, and in metropolitan scientific societies and entertainment organisations located close to the RGS. It elucidates the society's engagement with the lantern and the diverse perceptions of the medium within that institution. It traces the lantern's gradual introduction across three RGS meetings between 1886 and 1888, during the society's wider reformation and its promotion of geographical education and science. This recasts Halford Mackinder's ‘On the Scope and Methods of Geography’ as a lantern-slide lecture. Addressing how, when and why this medium became a part of the RGS's knowledge-making practices, and examining the debates around the use of this technology, the paper relates this process to a broader context of visual practices, the professionalization of academic geography and understandings of nineteenth-century geographical modernity.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhg.2018.04.003,"['Visual geography', 'Magic lantern', 'Royal Geographical Society', 'Popular geography', 'Halford Mackinder', 'Academic professionalization']",Journal of Historical Geography,"Geographical light: the magic lantern, the reform of the Royal Geographical Society and the professionalization of geography c.1885-1894"
46,"Highlights•A multilevel approach is proposed for the exploration of interdisciplinary research (IDR) centers.•We study the patterns of knowledge integration and the forms of research organization in IDR centers in Japan and the US.•We demonstrate that the realities of KI in IDR centers are far from full convergence idealizations..•We provide cues about the management, organization, and assessment of KI in IDR centers.•An integrated and systematic understanding of KI is crucial for fostering interdisciplinarity.The fostering of interdisciplinarity is increasingly requested of research organizations. However, conventional approaches to academic research management limit our understanding of the way interdisciplinary research (IDR) centers integrate multiple disciplines. This paper proposes a multilevel approach to explore the patterns of knowledge integration and the forms of research organization emerging from the practices and activities of IDR centers. Several bibliometric-based, network-oriented and visualization-rich approaches are used. The cases of two prominent IDR centers are considered: Harvard University's Wyss Institute and Kyoto University's WPI-iCeMS. At the macro level, our results show similarities in the scientific positioning of both IDR centers, which translate into differences in the nature, intensity and drivers of their knowledge interconnections at the meso-level. At the micro-level, we demonstrate that far from idealizations of full convergence, the realities of IDR centers are characterized by heterogeneous patchworks of multi-trajectory research domains—some of these enabling, others generating interdisciplinary knowledge. Differences in knowledge integration occur between but also, and more importantly, within IDR centers. Thus, tailored strategies tuned to the particularities of organizations and topic-based forms of research organization appear to cope better with interdisciplinary knowledge. The understanding of these inter- and intra-organizational differences proves crucial for effectively fostering knowledge integration. An integrated model relating levels of research management and visualization approaches is proposed for the management and assessment of knowledge integration in IDR centers.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (285KB)Download full-size image",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.technovation.2017.01.003,"['Interdisciplinarity', 'Knowledge integration', 'Knowledge structures', 'Bibliometric mapping', 'University research centers', 'R&D management/assessment', 'Multilevel approach', 'Convergence']",Technovation,Multilevel exploration of the realities of interdisciplinary research centers for the management of knowledge integration
47,"Social commerce, an emerging phenomenon rooted in social media and Web 2.0 technologies, has attracted the attention of many researchers. The number of publications on social commerce has grown exponentially in the past 10 years. Now, social commerce has become a significant emerging research area. In this paper, we first define the boundary of social commerce research and then attempt to review the extant literature in this area comprehensively and systematically. Based on the definition, this study surveyed 1369 peer-reviewed academic publications in the social media, Web 2.0, and other related areas. Following the survey, 418 of the publications were identified as social commerce research. Then, latent semantic analysis (LSA), a text mining approach, was applied to summarize the current state of social commerce research. LSA results show that there are three major research themes in the current social commerce research: organization, advertisement, and word-of-mouth. Each theme discusses topics such as innovation, user-generated content, and reputation, among others. In addition, we identify some interesting trends. The first main trend is that innovation, corporate reputation, and user-generated content remain the major research topics, although they are experiencing a slight decline. The second main trend is that online reviews, trust, and e-word-of-mouth are attracting more attention from researchers.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2016.06.006,"['Social media', 'Social commerce', 'Consumer-generated content', 'Organization', 'Advertisement', 'Word-of-mouth', 'E-word-of-mouth']",International Journal of Information Management,"Social commerce research: Definition, research themes and the trends"
48,"Highlights•Qualitative and quantitative methods used for vertical and horizontal research.•5 topics: trust; guanxi vs. equity; power distance; harmony; shared information.•Safety culture needs trusted leaders; communication; team reporting; incentives.This paper examines the effect on aviation safety of cultural differences between Chinese and Western commercial airline pilots. James Reason and Alan Hobbs’ Safety Culture model of a Just Culture, a Reporting Culture, and a Learning Culture was applied to the vertical aspect to measure Safety Culture in a multi-dimensional mode; a comparison of Chinese culture and Western culture on aviation safety was applied to the horizontal aspect to investigate the two different cultures. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used for this research. The interviews yielded five topics: trust, guanxi (relationship) vs. equity and equality, power distances, harmony among people, and sharing information and knowledge. For each of the five topics, questionnaires were developed to investigate the effects of cultural differences on international commercial airline pilots. A major finding was that the cultural differences strongly influence the pilots’ trust and satisfaction with the implementation of a Just Culture, a Reporting Culture, and a Learning Culture in their company. The Western pilots were more satisfied with those aspects of the Safety Culture model than were the Chinese pilots. Leadership that builds trust, includes a high power distance, and allows them to maintain harmony with their colleagues in a Reporting Culture is desired by Chinese pilots. Because it might have generated negative responses from their colleagues, Chinese pilots were more hesitant than were Western pilots to share information and knowledge. Finally, managers’ work histories, communication skills, good examples, team reporting, and incentive programs were suggested as vital for assuring the success of the Safety Culture.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2015.05.011,"['Cultural differences', 'Just Culture', 'Learning Culture', 'Reporting Culture', 'Safety Culture']",Safety Science,Safety Culture in commercial aviation: Differences in perspective between Chinese and Western pilots
49,"This paper examines the premiums paid by U.S.-listed Chinese companies in going-private transactions over the period from 2010 to 2012 and tests several incentive hypotheses for taking public companies private. Apart from the factors representing perceived difficulties and potential litigation risks in buying back shares, and corporate governance and agency issues, we focus our attention on the undervaluation of share prices and the amount of cash holdings of the sample firms. The latter two factors turn out to be the primary drivers of the premiums paid. Our empirical evidence strongly suggests that the current phase of going-private transactions by U.S.-listed Chinese firms is most likely to be linked to arbitrage considerations, i.e., to arbitrage the undervalued share prices and the cash holdings available to the acquirers.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iref.2014.01.008,"['Firm undervaluation', 'Corporate governance', 'Going private', 'G32', 'G34', 'K22', 'M40']",International Review of Economics & Finance,Going private transactions by U.S.-Listed Chinese companies: What drives the premiums paid?
50,"The paper focuses on various legal-related aspects of the application of blockchain technologies in the copyright sphere. Specifically, it outlines the existing challenges for distribution of copyrighted works in the digital environment, how they can be solved with blockchain, and what associated issues need to be addressed in this regard. It is argued that blockchain can introduce long-awaited transparency in matters of copyright ownership chain; substantially mitigate risks of online piracy by enabling control over digital copy and creating a civilized market for “used” digital content. It also allows to combine the simplicity of application of creative commons/open source type of licenses with revenue streams, and thus facilitate fair compensation of authors by means of cryptocurrency payments and Smart contracts. However, these benefits do not come without a price: many new issues will need to be resolved to enable the potential of blockchain technologies. Among them are: where to store copyrighted content (on blockchain or “off-chain”) and the associated need to adjust the legal status of online intermediaries; how to find a right balance between immutable nature of blockchain records and the necessity to adjust them due to the very nature of copyright law, which assigns ownership based on a set of informal facts, not visible to the public. Blockchain as a kind of time stamping service cannot itself ensure the trustworthiness of facts, which originate “off-chain”. More work needs to be done on the legal side: special provisions aimed at facilitating user's trust in blockchain records and their good faith usage of copyrighted works based on them need to be introduced and transactions with cryptocurrencies have to be legalized as well as the status of Smart contracts and their legal consequences. Finally, the economics of blockchain copyright management systems need to be carefully considered in order to ensure that they will have necessary network effects. If those issues are resolved in a satisfactory way, blockchain has the potential to rewrite how the copyright industry functions and digital content is distributed.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2017.11.008,"['Copyright', 'Blockchain', 'Smart contracts', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Digital content']",Computer Law & Security Review,Copyright in the blockchain era: Promises and challenges

This study explores the link between ESSP use and its potential performance impacts. Our findings show that ESSP use influences employee performance in two ways: through improved task performance and employee innovation. We also show that task equivocality moderates the relationship between ESSP use and employee performance outcomes, with ESSP use having a stronger impact on the performance of non-routine tasks. Finally, we show that using ESSPs for connecting within teams has a stronger effect on task performance, while using ESSP for connecting across teams has a stronger effect on employee innovation. These results can help researchers and practitioners better understand how ESSP use affects employee performance and the conditions best suited to achieve these performance outcomes in an enterprise setting.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsis.2015.04.001,"['Impact of IS use', 'Intra-team relationships', 'Inter-team collaboration', 'Innovative performance', 'Task performance', 'Social software']",The Journal of Strategic Information Systems,What’s in IT for employees?

52,"Based on the Field Theory, this study postulates that the cognitive processes involved in making decisions to share information on social media platforms could be dynamically affected by network features and the contextual environment. The field effect is exerted by the reach and richness of network features, which virtually form a psychological pressure on one’s perception of the sharing situation. A research model is developed, in which the effects of extrinsic and intrinsic motivators on information-sharing continuance are moderated by the network features of social media platforms. A global sample from content contributors in two major social media platform contexts, experience-socialization (ES) platforms (N = 568) and intelligence-proliferation (IP) platforms (N = 653), were collected through the participatory research method. By using partial least-square analysis, the moderating effects of network features on cognitive-sharing processes under the two contexts were confirmed. For contributors on ES platforms, network features negatively moderate community identification and perceived enjoyment toward information sharing. By contrast, for contributors on IP platforms, network features negatively moderate the effects of perceived usefulness and altruistic tendencies on their intention to share, but self-efficacy for sharing is positively induced. The conceptualization of network features and refined knowledge about the situational and contextual effects of social media platforms are useful for further studies on social behaviors and may ultimately benefit platform providers in their attempts to promote information-sharing continuance.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.im.2016.06.008,"['Social media', 'Information-sharing continuance', 'Extrinsic motivation', 'Intrinsic motivation', 'Network features', 'Reach and richness']",Information & Management,Field effects of social media platforms on information-sharing continuance: Do reach and richness matter?

The integrated approach collects customers’ relevant perceptual vocabulary and service properties based on the Kansei Engineering procedure. Subsequently, it quantifies the relationship among service properties, perceptual responses and usage intention through the data mining technique using a decision tree. A case of door-to-door delivery (D2DD) service is adopted to demonstrate that the proposed approach can incorporate the customers’ feelings into the process of service design or improvement and illustrate that the decision tree is suitable to be integrated with Kansei Engineering. The analytical results show the influence of a combination of different service properties (resp. perceptual responses) on a perceptual response (resp. usage intention). It is found that the combinations of crucial perceptual responses result in positive (resp. negative) usage intention and the property combinations result in these crucial perceptual responses. Accordingly, the D2DD service provider can improve or create its service based on the research findings.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2018.05.011,"['Service design', 'Kansei Engineering', 'Decision tree', 'Door-to-door delivery service']",Computers & Industrial Engineering,Applying Kansei Engineering and data mining to design door-to-door delivery service
57,"Close relationship researchers have proposed that the increased sharing, helping, and sacrifice among social partners of all kinds—friends, spouses, and biological kin—are mediated by the same internal indicator: the feeling of emotional closeness. However, recent work on ""kinship premiums"" in the U.S. and Europe show that emotional closeness is not sufficient to account for increased giving among genetic kin, suggesting that closeness may not be a sufficient proximate mechanism to account for giving in other evolutionarily important relationships. Using a hypothetical social discounting paradigm with a $75 reward, we test for such premiums among mates, close friends, and kin in two cultural settings where researchers have proposed key differences in relationship cognition–India (N = 63) and the U.S. (N = 284). We find that emotional closeness substantially mediates (often fully) the effect of close friendship on the amount of money forgone, suggesting that this is a key factor in the increased sharing observed among friends. On the other hand, people on average report sacrificing an additional $8.3 (95% CI: $4.5–$12.1) for mates and $9.7 (95% CI: $6.5–$12.8) for genetic kin when removing the effects of closeness. Importantly, these effects are not statistically different across samples from the U.S. and India. These results show that people use relationship-specific information about genetic relatedness and pair bonding in addition to general indicators of emotional closeness when making decisions to share with others.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2014.10.002,"['Close relationships', 'Kinship', 'Friendship', 'Social discounting', 'Altruism', 'Emotional closeness']",Evolution and Human Behavior,"Closeness is enough for friends, but not mates or kin: mate and kinship premiums in India and U.S."
58,"Highlights•A Chinese service company is using a combined ERP and ESS system for its customer processing.•We use the term hybrid ERP to describe the combined ERP and ESS system.•The case study outlines how the hybrid ERP helped facilitate the establishment of a hybrid organisation that offers the potential to incorporate both formal processes and informal processes that are directed towards organisational goals.•The research provides a definition of a hybrid organisation that can be facilitated by the use of a hybrid ERP system.This research traces the implementation of an information system in the form of ERP modules covering tenant and contract management in a Chinese service company. Misalignments between the ERP system specification and user needs led to the adoption of informal processes within the organisation. These processes are facilitated within an informal organisational structure and are based on human interactions undertaken within the formal organisation. Rather than to attempt to suppress the emergence of the informal organisation the company decided to channel the energies of staff involved in informal processes towards organisational goals. The company achieved this by harnessing the capabilities of what we term a hybrid ERP system, combining the functionality of a traditional (formal) ERP installation with the capabilities of Enterprise Social Software (ESS). However the company recognised that the successful operation of the hybrid ERP system would require a number of changes in organisational design in areas such as reporting structures and communication channels. A narrative provided by interviews with company personnel is thematised around the formal and informal characteristics of the organisation as defined in the literature. This leads to a definition of the characteristics of the hybrid organisation and strategies for enabling a hybrid organisation, facilitated by a hybrid ERP system, which directs formal and informal behaviour towards organisational goals and provides a template for future hybrid implementations.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2016.05.007,"['Hybrid organisation', 'Enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'Enterprise social software (ESS)', 'China', 'Informal organisation']",Computers in Industry,Building the hybrid organisation through ERP and enterprise social software
59,"Highlights•We provide a longitudinal case study of the experience of employees and managers following a radical innovation.•Social practice theory is used to interpret the organization's cultural changes as a result of the radical innovation.•The radical innovation caused a shared organic organizational culture to become separated and mechanistic.•The changes in working practice were interpreted in different ways reflected as fields of radical innovation.Organic organizational structures and cultures facilitate innovation because they allow organizations to shift their understanding of what a product, service or technology means. Yet, organic organizations may have to instill mechanistic structures and bureaucratic processes if they produce successful radical innovations. Thus, the basis of innovation can be undermined by its consequences. To explore this issue, this paper analyzes data from an ongoing longitudinal case study of a SME digital-design agency that developed a radical innovation for the market research industry. The paper observes that founders of the organization shifted their position to become managers as a result of their radical innovation and that other members of the organization have, consequently, re-evaluated their attitude toward the organization. To conceptualize our findings we turn to the work of Pierre Bourdieu. His notion of fields—which structure experiences and are, themselves, structured by experiences—offers a framework to understand the dynamics within an organization that occur as a result of a successful radical innovation. The contribution of our paper is: theoretically, we relate the discussion of innovation to wider social theories of practice and, thus, introduce temporal and cultural dynamics into the account of radical innovation; methodologically, we provide an example of a longitudinal study; and, in managerial terms, we indicate where divisions occur within an organization concerning the construction of meaning between managers and employees after a radical innovation.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2014.08.008,"['Fields of radical innovation', 'Bourdieu', 'Creative industries', 'Practice theory', 'Market research']",Industrial Marketing Management,The field of radical innovation: Making sense of organizational cultures and radical innovation

This has exponentially increased both complexity and uncertainty in the manufacturing landscape, creating serious challenges for competitive enterprises. For enterprises to remain competitive, analysing manufacturing activities and designing systems to address emergent needs, in a timely and efficient manner, is understood to be crucial. However, existing analysis and design approaches adopt a narrow diagnostic focus on either managerial or engineering aspects and neglect to consider the holistic complex behaviour of enterprises in a collaborative manufacturing network (CMN). It has been suggested that reflecting upon ecosystem theory may bring a better understanding of how to analyse the CMN. The research presented in this paper draws on a theoretical discussion with aim to demonstrate a facilitating approach to those analysis and design tasks. This approach was later operationalised using enterprise modelling (EM) techniques in a novel, developed framework that enhanced systematic analysis, design, and business-IT alignment. It is expected that this research view is opening a new field of investigation.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2016.04.003,"['Collaborative manufacturing network (CMN)', 'Enterprise modelling (EM)', 'Enterprise simulation', 'Ecosystem theory', 'Enterprise analysis and design']",Computers in Industry,Ecosystem-inspired enterprise modelling framework for collaborative and networked manufacturing systems

This article analyzes the weight that different information sources exert in defining the overall information source construct. The authors adopt a multidimensional methodology; unlike prior research, this study considers the combined weight of various web platforms for determining the images of tourist destinations. Thus, in addition to integrating various explanatory models to detail how the images of a tourist destination form, this study adds web platform factors and thereby moves beyond the influences of traditional, offline sources of information. The results of a survey of 541 tourists and residents of Mallorca, according to different descriptive statistics and exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, indicate that different websites, reflecting both supplier- and user-generated content, exert important influences and combine to form an information source construct. Furthermore, users who publish tourist information online value web platforms that offer user-generated content when they seek information about a tourist destination for themselves. These findings in turn offer several managerial recommendations.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2014.11.012,"['Social media', 'Image', 'Tourist destination', 'Information sources']",Tourism Management,A multidimensional analysis of the information sources construct and its relevance for destination image formation

For that reason, this study explores technology brand loyalty to verify its key predictors and mediators for understanding such loyalty in depth. Specifically, this study predicts the effects of social identity complexity and need for social approval on technology brand loyalty by simultaneously assessing the mediating mechanisms of susceptibility to normative influence (SNI) and susceptibility to personality congruence (SPC). Using a survey of 312 smartphone users from the high-tech, financial, and service industries, empirical testing confirms that perceived value and SPC are direct drivers for brand loyalty. Brand loyalty can be enhanced if a clear personality of the brand appears for its major consumers based on the findings of this study.

However, determinants of LCA passenger loyalty, such as service employee self-efficacy, price, service recovery, passenger trust and satisfaction, are overlooked. Therefore, this paper examines key antecedents' effect on LCA passenger loyalty. We conducted surveys at two major British airports of 286 LCA passengers who had experienced service failure. Our results indicate that efficacious service employees not only positively influence service recovery and price but also enhance passenger trust. Service employee self-efficacy diminishes bad service experiences; primarily, however, it boosts passenger satisfaction. Our structural equation modelling findings also support our hypothetical predictions that service employee self-efficacy, service recovery and passenger trust have a dramatic impact on passenger satisfaction. Passenger satisfaction is the uppermost driver of passenger loyalty enhancement, not of price. This study provides novel insight regarding LCA passengers' behaviours, as well as managerial and research implications for effective passenger relationship management.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2014.07.010,"['Low-cost airline business model', 'Disruptive innovation-led price', 'Service employee self-efficacy', 'Service recovery', 'Passenger satisfaction', 'Passenger trust', 'Passenger loyalty']",Tourism Management,Key determinants of passenger loyalty in the low-cost airline business

We argue that channel diversity is positively associated with a firm's profitability and negatively associated with its profit volatility, and that channel diversity and product diversity are complementary in driving these profit-enhancing and volatility-suppressing effects. We test our hypotheses in the U.S. credit union industry, in which credit unions offer a variety of loan and deposit products through a variety of online and offline channels, including physical branches, ATMs, telephone banking, online banking, and mobile banking. By analyzing a longitudinal dataset of 7577 credit unions in 2009–2016, the study provides empirical evidence that operating a full spectrum of online and offline channels leads to higher profitability and lower profit volatility for credit unions. The study also reveals differential moderating effects of loan product diversity and deposit product diversity, in that loan product diversity enhances the profit-enhancing effect of channel diversity while deposit product diversity enhances the volatility-suppressing effect of channel diversity.

68,"Vehicular networking has become a significant research area due to its specific features and applications such as standardization, efficient traffic management, road safety and infotainment. Vehicles are expected to carry relatively more communication systems, on board computing facilities, storage and increased sensing power. Hence, several technologies have been deployed to maintain and promote Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Recently, a number of solutions were proposed to address the challenges and issues of vehicular networks. Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) is one of the solutions. VCC is a new hybrid technology that has a remarkable impact on traffic management and road safety by instantly using vehicular resources, such as computing, storage and internet for decision making. This paper presents the state-of-the-art survey of vehicular cloud computing. Moreover, we present a taxonomy for vehicular cloud in which special attention has been devoted to the extensive applications, cloud formations, key management, inter cloud communication systems, and broad aspects of privacy and security issues. Through an extensive review of the literature, we design an architecture for VCC, itemize the properties required in vehicular cloud that support this model. We compare this mechanism with normal Cloud Computing (CC) and discuss open research issues and future directions. By reviewing and analyzing literature, we found that VCC is a technologically feasible and economically viable technological shifting paradigm for converging intelligent vehicular networks towards autonomous traffic, vehicle control and perception systems.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnca.2013.08.004,"['Vehicular networks', 'Road vehicle control', 'Intelligent transportation systems', 'Cloud computing', 'Vehicular cloud computing']",Journal of Network and Computer Applications,A survey on vehicular cloud computing

Recent research, however, has moved beyond this perspective to examine how groups within and beyond the team identity influence consumption. Assimilating previous research findings, we advance a Multiple In-group Identity Framework (MIIF), which consists of three levels: (1) superordinate (e.g., team identity), (2) subgroup (e.g., specific stadium area), and (3) relational group (e.g., friends or family). In the MIIF, we conceptualise the complex array of groups to which a consumer may belong within a superordinate identity. Each level includes groups with varying degrees of inclusiveness, homogeneity, and interpersonal attachment to other consumers between members. Individuals seek out sub and relational group membership because solely identifying at the superordinate level may not provide optimal distinctiveness or sufficient interpersonal attachment to other consumers. This provides self-concept benefits that nourish and operate in complement with the superordinate identification. The extent that different in-group identities influence behaviour relates to their importance in a consumer's self-concept and relevance to context. We provide implications for theory and practice.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smr.2015.10.001,"['Consumer behaviour', 'Team identification', 'Subgroup identification', 'Relational identification']",Sport Management Review,The Multiple In-group Identity Framework

76,"Highlights•We examine the influence of smart grids on business model innovation.•We focus on electricity firms' value creation, value delivery, and value capture.•There is uncertainty about consumer engagement, government support, and new entrants.•Firms might postpone business model innovation until uncertainties have been resolved.Smart grids could revolutionize the electricity sector when they stimulate customer empowerment and allow new players such as ICT firms to participate. A key question is whether electricity firms would either benefit or lose from smart grid deployment, because their established business model might be at risk. This paper seeks to explain under which conditions smart grid deployment will have an enabling or a constraining effect on electricity firms' engagement in business model innovation. Critically reviewing existing studies on smart grids, the paper investigates the consequences of smart grid deployment on each of the elements of the business model: value creation, value delivery, and value capture. The main argument posited is that while there are many reasons to believe that electricity firms will embrace smart grids and innovate their business model to accommodate sustainable energy, there are still many uncertainties related to consumer engagement, government support, and new entrants that might induce them to wait with business model innovation until such uncertainties have been resolved. The paper contributes to the emerging literature on business models for smart grids by not only identifying factors that enable, but also those that inhibit the transition of electricity firms towards sustainable energy. In highlighting electricity firms' reasons to resist smart grid technology, the paper provides a more nuanced picture of the potential of smart grids to disrupt the long-standing business models in the electricity sector.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.07.078,"['Smart grids', 'Disruptive technology', 'Business models', 'Sustainable innovation', 'Electricity firms']",Journal of Cleaner Production,The consequences of smart grids for the business model of electricity firms

81,"Highlights•Information exchange has direct and indirect effects on performance of contractual international joint ventures (IJVs).•Relationship capital (mutual trust, reciprocal commitment) mediates the effect of information exchange on IJV performance.•Environmental uncertainty partially moderates the mediating effects of mutual trust and reciprocal commitment.•Study of 205 contractual IJVs in China has useful lessons for other emerging markets moving towards internationalization.Prior research on the role of international joint ventures (IJV) in the emerging markets generally ignores the impact of information exchange on IJV performance as well as the mediating role of relationship capital (a key measure of competitive dynamics and co-evolution) and the moderating impact of environmental uncertainty in this process. This paper addresses these important research gaps by exploring the direct effect of information exchange on IJV performance as well as indirect (mediated) effect through mutual trust and reciprocal commitment, two key components of relationship capital. In addition, this paper investigates the role of environmental uncertainty as a moderator of these mediating effects. Results from a study of 205 contractual IJVs in China, a highly competitive and dynamic emerging market, show that foreign and local partners collaborate and co-evolve through regular information exchange that helps them build relationship capital with each other in the form of mutual trust and reciprocal commitment, which in turn leads to better IJV performance. In addition, environmental uncertainty negatively moderates (weakens) the positive effects of information exchange on mutual trust and reciprocal commitment but not their impact on IJV performance. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for future research on the role of relationship capital in the successful formation and management of IJVs in the emerging markets.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibusrev.2018.02.008,"['Contractual', 'Environmental uncertainty', 'Information exchange', 'International', 'Joint venture', 'Mutual trust', 'Reciprocal commitment', 'Relationship capital']",International Business Review,"Interactive effects of information exchange, relationship capital and environmental uncertainty on international joint venture (IJV) performance: An emerging markets perspective"

After studying the history of B2B marketing, building on configuration theory, and prospecting the future challenges for marketers, the authors argue that the research efforts should be focused on six major areas of inquiry: Innovation, Customer Journey and Relationship Value, Data Analytics, Harnessing Technology, Marketing/Finance Interface and Revenue Growth, and Industry Context or Ecosystem. Specifically, they propose 20 theoretical sub-categories that are compelling for academicians and relevant for B2B marketers.

83,"The study here presents a revolutionary new perspective in the consumer brand engagement (CBE) literature. The models advance a radically enhanced CBE and customer loyalty theory, grounded in complexity and sense-making theories. It describes how the use of set theoretic models and asymmetric analytics using Boolean algebra, rather than normative matrix algebra and symmetric analytics provide the means for testing major principles of complexity theory in CBE and presents a thought experiment of complexity theory tenets that provides alternative logic of asymmetric testing of variables affecting positive or negative consumer behavior. Aided by various graphics and complex multi-dimensional property space models, thought experiments, evidenced by netnographic cases, consumer brand enmeshment (CBEM) theory offers a reality-based expansion of consumers' responses to brand inter-actions and delivers a set of complex recipes that is likely to lead to a variety of opposable consumer brand inter-actions and brand enmeshments that simultaneously differ in direction and intensity.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.01.005,"['CLTV', 'Consumer behavior', 'Desirability', 'Inter-action intensity', 'Valence']",Journal of Business Research,Consumer brand enmeshment: Typography and complexity modeling of consumer brand engagement and brand loyalty enactments
84,"Highlights•Reviews the value claims made by four different talent management philosophies•Develops a theoretical framework to examine the value of talent management•Examines four concepts of value creation, value capture, value leverage and value protectionThe paper uses two concepts to organize the talent management literature: talent philosophies and a theory of value. It introduces the notion of talent management architectures and first analyses four talent management philosophies and the different claims they make about the value of individual talent and talent management architectures to demonstrate the limitations of human capital theory in capturing current developments. Having demonstrated the complexity of issues being researched, it then synthesises these back down into a theory of value, and develops a framework based on four separate value-generating processes (value creation, value capture, value leverage and value protection). This framework draws upon a number of non-HR literatures, such as those on value creation, the RBV perspective, dynamic capabilities, and global knowledge management, and its use to understand the nature of value and how this might inform the design of any talent management system or architecture.

Due to the significant growth of this phenomenon, businesses in developed (e.g., United States) and developing countries (e.g., Kuwait) have become more engaged in the blogging behavior of their employees.The main objectives of this study are: (1) to lay the groundwork for understanding the critical factors that lead to corporate bloggers' stickiness to corporate user-generated media sites (e.g., corporate blogs or corporate social media accounts) and (2) to understand organizations' awareness of the potential liabilities resulting from the actions of managers or employees in violation of different laws when blogging for the company. The study uses survey data collected from managers in the United States (U.S.) and Kuwait to meet these objectives.Five hypotheses are tested in this study. The results of the structural model indicate that corporate bloggers' attitude, corporate bloggers' subjective norm, and corporate bloggers' perceived behavioral control are positively related to corporate bloggers' stickiness to blog. The results also suggest that corporate bloggers' perceived behavioral control leads to corporate bloggers' commitment to blog. Finally, the results indicate that corporate bloggers' stickiness to blog is a positive predictor of corporate bloggers' commitment to blog.The results further suggest that corporate bloggers' stickiness to blog partially mediates the relationship between corporate bloggers' perceived behavioral control and their commitment to blog. Overall, the results of the structural model for the U.S. and Kuwait samples generate similar findings.

There are diverse forms of couplings embedded in poor-structured and ill-structured data. Such couplings are ubiquitous, implicit and/or explicit, objective and/or subjective, heterogeneous and/or homogeneous, presenting complexities to existing learning systems in statistics, mathematics and computer sciences, such as typical dependency, association and correlation relationships. Modeling and learning such couplings thus is fundamental but challenging. This paper discusses the concept of coupling learning, focusing on the involvement of coupling relationships in learning systems. Coupling learning has great potential for building a deep understanding of the essence of business problems and handling challenges that have not been addressed well by existing learning theories and tools. This argument is verified by several case studies on coupling learning, including handling coupling in recommender systems, incorporating couplings into coupled clustering, coupling document clustering, coupled recommender algorithms and coupled behavior analysis for groups.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2014.08.007,"['Coupling learning', 'Coupling relationship', 'Interaction learning', 'Non-IIDness learning', 'Invisibility learning']",Information Processing & Management,Coupling learning of complex interactions

Yet, the questions of how to respond to online reviews continue to baffle hotel managers. By focusing on prospective travelers, we propose the effective management response signals hotels' care for customers and quality of service. Particularly, we postulate the frequency, speed and length of response influence the effectiveness of signaling in reducing information asymmetry. Based on the large-scale field data from TripAdvisor, this study demonstrates that the frequency and speed of response significantly enhance travelers’ engagement as indicated by more reviews, higher average valence, more votes for helpfulness, and higher popularity ranking. Furthermore, the frequent and speedy response is more effective for budget (vs. premium) hotels. Thus, management response to online reviews serves as a critical channel of communication to engage customers.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2017.03.009,"['Hotel management', 'Customer engagement', 'Signaling', 'Online reviews', 'Management response']",Tourism Management,The signaling effect of management response in engaging customers: A study of the hotel industry

This study endeavored to ascertain the determinants compelling live streamers to continue broadcasting on Twitch, a live streaming video platform. This novel research model used self-determination theory to investigate different motivational forces (i.e., intrinsic and extrinsic) that drive live streamers’ continuance broadcasting intentions. Both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation significantly influenced live streamers’ performance expectancies, but not their perceived website attractiveness. Efforts to influence perceived website attractiveness must be made via performance expectancies. Performance expectancy and perceived website attractiveness subsequently affect streamers’ continuance of broadcasting intentions on Twitch. This study yields important managerial implications for live streaming platforms to improve their service design and understanding of streamers’ behavioral intentions.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2017.12.018,"['Live streaming', 'Live streamer', 'Self-determination theory', 'Motivation', 'Continuance broadcasting intention']",Telematics and Informatics,Determinants of live streamers’ continuance broadcasting intentions on Twitch: A self-determination theory perspective
90,"Highlights•A biocultural model of subadult scurvy in the Southwest is presented. Social inequalities and environmental instability are associated with scurvy in these samples.•Ritual violence, raiding and resource exploitation exposed children to greater risk of long-term undernutrition.•These data illustrate that nutrition has long been impacted by political economies in human societies in predictable ways.As Donald Ortner and other scholars have noted, the prevalence of subadult scurvy ranges widely among skeletal assemblages. Prevalence variation across the Americas has been attributed to seasonality and environmental instability, although no cohesive model has been proposed. Integrating new evidence from an analysis of 31 burials found in an ancestral Tepehaun cave site (A.D. 571–1168), this paper proposes a model of biosocial change and nutritional stress for the Prehispanic American Southwest. The role of warfare and social control are emphasized to complement prior studies that have focused on the role of droughts and aggregation.Bioarchaeological evidence demonstrates that scurvy prevalence increases among subadults in association with violence and exploitation by regional political centers. Hinterland communities exhibit higher prevalence rates of scurvy than found within nearby political centers. This is consistent with hypotheses that social control involved complex inequalities in resource redistribution in the Southwest that negatively impacted the communities from which food resources were extracted. Evidence of scurvy also appears to be found most often in assemblages associated with violent conflict. Further exploration of the role structural inequalities play in shaping nutrition will enable a better understanding of how to improve health in contexts of resource instability.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpp.2014.05.001,"['Vitamin C deficiency', 'Scurvy', 'Violence', 'Inequality', 'Differential diagnosis', 'Paleopathology', 'Tepehuan', 'Southwest']",International Journal of Paleopathology,Scurvy in the Greater American Southwest: Modeling micronutrition and biosocial processes in contexts of resource stress

It is observed that the use of big data architecture and techniques are continuously assisting in managing the expeditious data growth in healthcare industry. Here, initially an empirical study is performed to analyze the role of big data in healthcare industry. It has been observed that significant work has been done using big data in healthcare sector. Nowadays, it is intricate to envision the way the machine learning and big data can influence the healthcare industries. It has been observed that most of the authors who implemented the use of machine learning and big data analytics in disease diagnosis have not given significant weightage to the privacy and security of the data. Here, a novel design of smart and secure healthcare information system using machine learning and advanced security mechanism has been proposed to handle big data of medical industry. The innovation lies in the incorporation of optimal storage and data security layer used to maintain security and privacy. Different techniques like masking encryption, activity monitoring, granular access control, dynamic data encryption and end point validation have been incorporated. The proposed hybrid four layer healthcare model seems to be more effective disease diagnostic big data system.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2018.05.020,"['Big Data', 'Healthcare', 'Big data analytics', 'disease diagnosis', 'predictive analysis', 'security', 'privacy']",Procedia Computer Science,Big Data and Machine Learning Based Secure Healthcare Framework

Survey responses of 308 managers from a wide spectrum of manufacturing firms have been validated and analyzed by means of structural equation modelling. The findings indicate that dimensions of e-maintenance technology readiness in manufacturing firms are mainly influenced by technological and organizational determinants involving technological infrastructure and competence, expected benefits and challenges of e-maintenance, and firm size and ownership. Surprisingly, there is no significant effect of competitive pressures on e-maintenance readiness. This study offers managers and vendors a frame of reference to analyze firm's situation before initiating new innovations. In case of e-maintenance technology, adoption strategies should be built around fostering level of employees’ technological knowledge and skills, technology infrastructure as well as sustaining potential benefits and encountering potential challenges associated with e-maintenance technology.

Smart cities contribute to social stability and economic prosperity by encouraging and enabling corporations to invest their resources and expertise in the cities, and by providing more prosperity and contentment for their citizens. Smart city services provide citizens with an improved living environment and increase their overall quality of life. Since the citizens are the users of the services, it is vitally important that their ideas and perspectives are taken into account during the planning and management of such services. This study surveyed citizens in Taiwanese cities that had all participated in the Intelligent Community Forum smart city campaigns at least once. The findings reveal that citizens are willing to accept and use ICT-based smart city services if the services are designed with innovative concepts that secure their privacy and offer a high quality of services. The more they use the services, the higher the quality of life achieved. The only factor that does not influence citizens' acceptance and usage of ICT-based smart city services is their city engagement.

While these websites include relational features (e.g., communities and areas for regular visitors, electronic bulletin boards, forums, and RSS feeds), can they be considered relational according to the relationship marketing paradigm? To answer this question, we conduct a qualitative study with 19 Internet experts. The results show that two approaches can be used to define a relational website. The first approach suggests that a website's relationship proneness (WRP) is driven by three dimensions: content, exchange, and look and feel. The second approach is enumerative: the more electronic customer relationship management (eCRM) features a website offers, the more relational it is considered to be. Managerial and theoretical implications lie in the complementary relationship between these two approaches.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.emj.2016.11.001,"['Relational website', 'Relationship marketing', 'eCRM', 'eCRM features', 'Qualitative methods']",European Management Journal,What makes a website relational?

1,"Highlights•We propose a conceptual framework to examine business concept for e-healthcare.•e-Healthcare encompasses a broader customer space than the cared to form a commercially viable business concept.•The timing and location aspects have become relevant and crucial to e-healthcare services.•Service benefits means more than value propositions in designing business concept for e-healthcare.This paper contributes to the current understanding of systemic service innovations by making intensive inquiries into the issue of how to formulate a commercially viable business concept for e-healthcare. Business models as key to success in service innovations require formulating and articulating a good and meaningful business concept right from the beginning. Taking into account the systemic nature of e-healthcare services, the paper develops a conceptual framework and presents four cases gathered from Taiwan׳s innovative e-healthcare programs to unveil the key ingredients of the business concept required for innovative e-healthcare services.Quite often, demand for e-healthcare services is associated with the healthcare and wellbeing need of the elderly and/or people with chronic diseases. In fact, such a view may be oversimplified. Instead, when paying attention to a distinction between direct demand and “derived” demand, one may better deal with an important issue of who is to pay. In addition, for e-healthcare to develop into commercially viable service innovation, the timing and location aspects, apart from those of people and information, have become relevant and crucial.The results of our case studies suggest that the needs of the cared may have different shades of meanings, in terms of value proposition. We introduce a few terms “nice-to-have”, “had-better-have” and “must-have” to differentiate value to customers. Differences between these terms have implications for issues such as how crucial the service is to the users and customers and their willingness to pay.With no intention to play down the patient-centered view proposed by experts from other disciplines, we suggest that the service organization of e-healthcare needs to take a broad view towards customer space and service benefit, especially when it comes to the formation of a commercially viable business concept. In addition, e-healthcare services are not just means of promoting healthcare service quality and health interest of the service recipients, but may bring about a substantial impact on the cost and revenue structure of the service organization. It is therefore essential for the manager in the hospital to consider e-healthcare services as an integral part of medical care operations, when evaluating the cost-effectiveness of e-healthcare.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.technovation.2014.03.002,"['Systemic service innovation', 'Business concept', 'Business model', 'e-healthcare']",Technovation,Business concepts of systemic service innovations in e-Healthcare

It proposes a conceptual model integrating variables that have been studied in previous research on brand trust, OBC identification, and satisfaction, and others that have received little or no research attention, including the OBC sponsor’s opportunism, sponsor’s control, and OBC experience, with OBC engagement playing a key role. The conceptual model has been tested by applying structural equation modelling to a database of 628 consumers belonging to over 260 different online brand communities OBC from diverse economic sectors: for example, brands involving sports (Adidas and Nike), fashion (Mango, Stradivarius and Zara) and technology (Apple, Samsung and Sony). In general, the authors conclude the importance of engagement in explaining a member’s involvement in a community, and the important role played by antecedents such as online brand community experience and trust, not only directly but also indirectly via identification with the community. The results confirm the influence of engagement upon a member’s participation in a community. Our study supports this direction of the relationship over the reverse – participation engagement – as suggested by other previous works. With regard to the antecedents of trust in the online brand community, it has been concluded that using the community for mainly commercial purposes has a negative effect.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.elerap.2017.04.002,"['Brand engagement', 'Community sponsor', 'Consumer engagement', 'Online brand communities', 'Participation engagement', 'Structural equation modeling', 'Survey research']",Electronic Commerce Research and Applications,Consumer engagement in an online brand community
3,"The impacts of information technology (IT) on total factor productivity (TFP) are assessed through an integrative framework of IT-induced externalities and IT-leveraged innovations. Based on network externalities and endogenous growth theory, our study aims to reconcile the seeming discrepancy between the recent observed evidence and the prediction by neoclassical growth theory. We argue that computerization has reshaped the competitive landscape into a network economy with IT-induced externalities that benefit not only IT purchasers but also other stakeholders. Moreover, IT is a platform technology that can leverage innovations to enhance the technological level of production process. Consequently, these two factors of IT-induced externalities and IT-leveraged innovations exert positive impacts on TFP, suggesting IT plays a more pivotal role than input consumption and accumulation that neoclassical growth theory assumes for IT. We use panel data from 30 Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries over the period of 2000–2009 to empirically test hypotheses on this IT-TFP link. Implications are drawn from our findings for future research to measure IT׳s contributions at the macro level more accurately, and policymakers are urged to cultivate IT׳s positive impacts on TFP to help sustain long-term economic growth.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2014.08.003,"['Impacts of information technology', 'Total factor productivity', 'Network externalities', 'Endogenous growth theory', 'Innovations', 'Production economics.']",International Journal of Production Economics,The impacts of information technology on total factor productivity: A look at externalities and innovations
4,"ObjectivesThe purposes of this review of unfinished care were to: (1) compare conceptual definitions and frameworks associated with unfinished care and related synonyms (i.e. missed care, implicitly rationed care; and care left undone); (2) compare and contrast approaches to instrumentation; (3) describe prevalence and patterns; (4) identify antecedents and outcomes; and (5) describe mitigating interventions.MethodsA literature search in CINAHL and MEDLINE identified 1828 articles; 54 met inclusion criteria. Search terms included: implicit ration*, miss* care, ration* care, task* undone, and unfinish*care. Analysis was performed in three phases: initial screening and sorting, comprehensive review for data extraction (first author), and confirmatory review to validate groupings, major themes, and interpretations (second author).ResultsReviewed literature included 42 quantitative reports; 7 qualitative reports; 1 mixed method report; and 4 scientific reviews. With one exception, quantitative studies involved observational cross-sectional survey designs. A total of 22 primary samples were identified; 5 involved systematic sampling. The response rate was >60% in over half of the samples. Unfinished care was measured with 14 self-report instruments. Most nursing personnel (55–98%) reported leaving at least 1 task undone. Estimates increased with survey length, recall period, scope of response referent, and scope of resource scarcity considered. Patterns of unfinished care were consistent with the subordination of teaching and emotional support activities to those related to physiologic needs and organizational audits. Predictors of unfinished care included perceived team interactions, adequacy of resources, safety climate, and nurse staffing. Unfinished care is a predictor of: decreased nurse-reported care quality, decreased patient satisfaction; increased adverse events; increased turnover; decreased job and occupational satisfaction; and increased intent to leave.Discussion & conclusionsUnfinished care is a significant problem in acute care hospitals internationally. Prioritization strategies of nurses leave patients vulnerable to unmet educational, emotional, and psychological needs.

5,"The cloud computing provides on demand services over the Internet with the help of a large amount of virtual storage. The main features of cloud computing is that the user does not have any setup of expensive computing infrastructure and the cost of its services is less. In the recent years, cloud computing integrates with the industry and many other areas, which has been encouraging the researcher to research on new related technologies. Due to the availability of its services & scalability for computing processes individual users and organizations transfer their application, data and services to the cloud storage server. Regardless of its advantages, the transformation of local computing to remote computing has brought many security issues and challenges for both consumer and provider. Many cloud services are provided by the trusted third party which arises new security threats. The cloud provider provides its services through the Internet and uses many web technologies that arise new security issues. This paper discussed about the basic features of the cloud computing, security issues, threats and their solutions. Additionally, the paper describes several key topics related to the cloud, namely cloud architecture framework, service and deployment model, cloud technologies, cloud security concepts, threats, and attacks.

As an alternative to existing models, we propose a new strategic path to study IT use through users’ IT culture and IT needs. Our contributions are (1) theoretical: we investigate the predictive value for IT usage of several new constructs and show that both expectancy-based and needs-based theories of motivation should be taken into account in acceptance models, (2) methodological: we adopt an exploratory, mixed-method, grounded theory approach and use both quantitative and qualitative data and methods, an unusual approach in IS research that allows new perspectives, and (3) practical: our results highlight the fact that highly IT-acculturated users may hinder (rather than facilitate) new-IT acceptance if their situational IT needs are ignored. Therefore, when the strategic decision of implementing new IT is made, managerial attention must be focused on these users in order to drive toward the alignment of their IT needs and managerially-perceived organizational IT needs.Our work opens the way to numerous avenues for future research.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsis.2013.06.001,"['IT culture', 'IT needs', 'IT acceptance', 'Mixed-methods grounded theory', 'Use']",The Journal of Strategic Information Systems,A strategic path to study IT use through users’ IT culture and IT needs: A mixed-method grounded theory

Personalization is introduced as an antecedent of socialness and satisfaction. The model is developed and tested using the corporate Web site of a large European utility and two rounds of surveys (n = 3284 and n = 2161 respectively). The results show that socialness has a strong association with satisfaction, and personalization with both socialness and satisfaction. We found a weaker albeit significant relationship between satisfaction and continuance intention than in Bhattacherjee's original study. We argue that this variation in findings can be explained by the extent to which usage of the information system is optional and develop the idea of exclusive informational sites. In such situations satisfaction becomes a key outcome variable, making antecedents of satisfaction – such as socialness – particularly relevant and important to the Web site design process.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2014.08.017,"['Expectation confirmation theory', 'Web site socialness', 'Personalization', 'Continuance intention', 'User satisfaction']",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,Technology socialness and Web site satisfaction

Despite existing documentation regarding the relationship between IT resource and knowledge management, limited information is available on the different types of IT resources describing this relationship. We integrate two research streams emerging in knowledge management and extend the literature on IT–knowledge management linkage by investigating the moderating role of resource commitment to invoke a contingent resource perspective. Data from 168 organizations in China provide empirical evidence that three types of IT resources (i.e., IT infrastructure, IT human, and IT relationship) positively affect knowledge management capability (KMC), which is positively related to competitive advantage. Furthermore, this study identifies two positive quasi-moderating effects of resource commitment on the IT resource–KMC relationship. Specifically, resource commitment directly and positively enhances KMC, and strengthens the effects of IT human and IT relationship resources on KMC.

The KAM teams in this study are formed of members originating from several supplier companies that integrate and apply resources with their customers in a business network. In the co-creation of integrated solutions within such business networks, KAM teams – drawing on organizational learning theory and knowledge management – are considered as knowledge integrators. The purpose of this study is to analyze the KAM teams' absorptive capacity — that is, how knowledge is acquired, assimilated, and applied in the co-creation of integrated solutions. The study employs a qualitative case study approach, based on 30 in-depth interviews in nine supplier companies operating in advertising, marketing and consulting, and in three key customer companies.

14,"Highlights•We develop theory about retailers’ response to unethical customer behavior.•Lawful ethical transgressions can have longer-term positive consequences.•Retailers should use more nuanced methods to deal with such behaviors.•We report a longitudinal study to support our theory.•We report a survey-based study of retail managers to provide evidence of nuanced response.The conventional wisdom, grounded in deontological ethics, is that retailers should extinguish unethical customer behavior. However, there exists an opposing teleological view that unethical behavior may be tolerated if its ultimate consequences are beneficial for all stakeholders. This is supported by a survey of retail managers conducted by the authors that revealed over 80% of the respondents are inclined to tolerate unethical customers whose actions have beneficial effects. The primary goal of this research is to investigate the boundaries of this teleological perspective, that is, whether ethical transgressions that appear to have negative short-term consequences for the retailer and other ethical customers can have beneficial longer-term consequences for all parties. We examine this question empirically with a longitudinal dataset, covering seventy weeks and over 48,000 accounts, from a popular Swiss online retailer. We focus on increased revenues and customer engagement as the benefit for the retailer. Our results show that customers registering multiple accounts in violation of the retailer’s policy comprise fewer than 11.5% of accounts, yet generate more than 27.6% of the retailer’s revenue. Specifically, their behavior leads to higher retailer revenues and greater engagement by other customers in the long-run. We discuss the implications of this insight for retailing managers as well as scholars.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (133KB)Download full-size image",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jretai.2017.09.005,"['Unethical customer behavior', 'Marketing ethics', 'Online shopping', 'Ethical transgression', 'Gamification']",Journal of Retailing,When Ethical Transgressions of Customers Have Beneficial Long-Term Effects in Retailing: An Empirical Investigation

SDLC (Software development life cycle) is responsible for software's reliability, performance, scalability, functionality and maintainability. Although all phases of SDLC have their own importance but Software architecture serves as the foundation for other phases of SDLC. Just like sketch of a building helps constructor to correctly construct the building, software architecture helps software developer to develop the software properly. There are various styles available for software architecture. In this paper, clear picture of all important software architecture styles are presented along with recent advancement in software architecture and design phases.

16,"Recent advances in technology have profoundly impacted the way firms interact and transact with current and prospective customers. The emergence of online channels has been of particular relevance, as it promotes consumers’ active participation in the value-creation process. In this study, we draw from the Stimulus-Organism-Response model to provide a theoretical understanding of the role played by two critical factors driving online customer-initiated contacts (OnCICs): social effects and perceived risk. Additionally, we establish a direct link between these interactions and customer profitability. We merge longitudinal objective data with subjective data for a sample of 1990 customers in financial services and apply partial least squares, revealing that social effects influence perceived risk. Perceived risk consequently promotes the development of OnCICs, while social effects reduce the need for such interactions. Finally, OnCICs help to promote high-quality relationships and leads to higher performance.

17,"Social business intelligence combines corporate data with user-generated content (UGC) to make decision-makers aware of the trends perceived from the environment. A key role in the analysis of textual UGC is played by topics, meant as specific concepts of interest within a subject area. To enable aggregations of topics at different levels, a topic hierarchy has to be defined. Some attempts have been made to address the peculiarities of topic hierarchies, but no comprehensive solution has been found so far. The approach we propose to model topic hierarchies in ROLAP systems is called meta-stars. Its basic idea is to use meta-modeling coupled with navigation tables and with dimension tables: navigation tables support hierarchy instances with different lengths and with non-leaf facts, and allow different roll-up semantics to be explicitly annotated; meta-modeling enables hierarchy heterogeneity and dynamics to be accommodated; dimension tables are easily integrated with standard business hierarchies. After outlining a reference architecture for social business intelligence and describing the meta-star approach, we formalize its querying expressiveness and give a cost model for the main query execution plans. Then, we evaluate meta-stars by presenting experimental results for query performances and disk space.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.is.2015.04.005,"['Business intelligence', 'Social media', 'User-generated content', 'Multidimensional modeling']",Information Systems,Advanced topic modeling for social business intelligence

These aspects are included in the model, proposed in this article, by the set of organizational factors which may influence the effective use of CRM solutions. Organizational factors are reflected in the three types of orientations – in process, technological and innovation orientation of organization.

In multimodal transport networks it is well acknowledged the use of information and communication technology (ICT) can deliver benefits that include real time track and trace, visibility and reduced lead-time, among others. Given the importance of the benefits associated to the adoption of ICT in the operation of multimodal transport networks, this work uses institutional-related theories in a multiple-case study comprising seven seaports terminals located in two continents. The purpose of the study is to identify key elements that affect and influence the adoption of ICT to support interoperability and connectivity in multi-modal seaport terminal operations. The analysis is used to identify groupings of influence linked to elements comprising institutional-related theories like coercion and mimesis, part of institutional isomorphism, among others. The study shows that both government legislation and dominant organizations running ports in various geographical locations exert great influence regarding ICT adoption policies in seaport terminals. The adoption of ICT has become important given the proliferation of technologies, the increasing need for track and trace capabilities and the economic impact of seaports terminals.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2017.01.014,"['ICT adoption', 'Seaport logistics', 'Multi-modality', 'Institutional isomorphism', 'Port research']",Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice,ICT adoption in multimodal transport sites: Investigating institutional-related influences in international seaports terminals

Analysis of 357 online technology ventures, created during the past 6 years, suggests that brand innovation is affected by both knowledge acquisition from social media and market orientation. Social media strategic capability positively affects brand innovation and acts as a moderator between knowledge acquisition, market orientation, and brand innovation. It further enhances both types of market orientations in achieving brand innovation, suggesting that on social media, customer's needs, both expressed and latent (or unexpressed), can be identified more comprehensively than that of the traditional setting. Hence, the context of social media provides a different set of rules for competition and strategic behavior, in which online technology ventures should note.

However, how and to what extent app developers collaborate with their peers needs to be investigated further. In this article, we study the interfirm relationships among app developers in commercial platform ecosystems and explore the causes of variation in the network structure of these ecosystems. By means of a comparative study of four commercial platform ecosystems of Google (Google Apps and Google Chrome) and Microsoft (Microsoft Office365 and Internet Explorer), we illustrate substantial variation in the extent to which app developers initiated interfirm relationships. Further, we analyze how the degree of enforced entry barriers to the app store, the use of a partnership model, and the domain of the software platform that underpins the ecosystem affect the properties of these commercial platform ecosystems.

28,"The selling environment has undergone tremendous transformation over the past 2 decades. Perhaps the greatest change has centered on changes and advancements in technology. The latest dramatic change has been the rapidly increasing use of social media and other related technologies in the business-to-business realm. The sales world began the use of technology through the use of Web 1.0, which was primarily webpage oriented; now we see the world of social media as the paradigm of how firms should implement technology. Although there has been some recent emphasis on how marketing might implement social media into their strategies and how the individual salesperson might implement social media into his or her daily selling routine, no substantive discussion on how social media is affecting the role of the sales manager has appeared in the literature. This article systematically examines how social media is impacting the sales management function and, in fact, may be dramatically revolutionizing the position. To help the marketing and sales organization better understand the changing sales world, we present eight lessons that every sales manager needs to embrace.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bushor.2014.09.009,"['Social media', 'Sales management', 'Selling', 'Sales technology', 'Gamification']",Business Horizons,Social media and related technology: Drivers of change in managing the contemporary sales force
29,"Highlights•We assess the added value of a Facebook user's friends data in event attendance prediction over and above user data.•We use five classification algorithms, five times two-fold cross-validation and the Wilcoxon signed rank test.•Including friends data increases the AUC significantly for most algorithms.•Among the top predictors is the number of friends that are attending the focal event.•These findings clearly indicate that including network data is a viable strategy.This paper seeks to assess the added value of a Facebook user's friends data in event attendance prediction over and above user data. For this purpose we gathered data of users that have liked an anonymous European soccer team on Facebook. In addition we obtained data from all their friends. In order to assess the added value of friends data we have built two models for five different algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Adaboost, Neural Networks and Naive Bayes). The baseline model contained only user data and the augmented model contained both user and friends data. We employed five times two-fold cross-validation and the Wilcoxon signed rank test to validate our findings. The results suggest that the inclusion of friends data in our predictive model increases the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Out of five algorithms, the increase is significant for three algorithms, marginally significant for one algorithm, and not significant for one algorithm. The increase in AUC ranged from 0.21%-points to 0.82%-points. The analyses show that a top predictor is the number of friends that are attending the focal event. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study that evaluates the added value of friends network data over and above user data in event attendance prediction on Facebook. These findings clearly indicate that including network data in event prediction models is a viable strategy for improving model performance.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2015.11.003,"['Facebook', 'Network data', 'Events', 'Predictive models', 'Social media']",Decision Support Systems,The added value of Facebook friends data in event attendance prediction

I interview forensic accountants and IT experts about the adoption, acceptance, institutional motives, and risks of cloud computing. Although the medium to large accounting firms where the external auditors worked almost exclusively used private clouds, both private and public cloud services were gaining a foothold among many of their clients. Despite the advantages of cloud computing, data confidentiality and the involvement of foreign jurisdictions remain a concern, particularly if the data are moved outside Australia. Additionally, some organizations seem to understand neither the technology itself nor their own requirements, which may lead to poorly negotiated contracts and service agreements. To minimize the risks associated with cloud computing, many organizations turn to hybrid solutions or private clouds that include national or dedicated data centers. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first empirical study that reports on cloud computing adoption from the perspectives of external auditors.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.accinf.2015.09.001,"['Cloud computing', 'Information technology outsourcing', 'Software as a service', 'Forensic accounting']",International Journal of Accounting Information Systems,External auditors' perceptions of cloud computing adoption in Australia
32,"The upcoming privatization of two remaining telecom operators in Bosnia, and not so recent privatization of one of the incumbent, will create dynamic and changing sector environment for all participants. At the same time the investors are scanning the sector trying to find the right approach and the market niche for more competitive start. In our overview we have looked at regulatory status, core services figures, followed by financial overview for incumbent operators in the past decade, as well as mobile users’ attitudes in carrier section. What we will show is that sector development and the expansion of consumers’ base is far from over. The services offered are still at rudimental level, and the potential owners of incumbent operators as well as new entrants will have considerable room for development. Financial analysis has shown that revenue for all three incumbent operators is stagnating in the last years, while the small private operators are experiencing steady growth. Although BH Telecom is still the largest company in the sector, it dose face slight decline in net profit while its biggest competitor – Telecom Srpske in 2013 had biggest ROE. We find that BH Telecom and Telecom Srpske had unexploited franchise growth and competiveness potential. We assessed the intrinsic value of all three companies stocks by application of Franchise Factor Model and find that BH Telecom stock price is in equilibrium, Telecom Srpske stock is underpriced and Croatian Telecom is stock strongly overpriced. Finally, the analyses of consumers’ perspective have revealed existence of network effect in mobile market and the strong competition between two market leaders.

Especially differences in the way strategic issues are perceived are likely to affect the amount of top level executive participation in decision making process. The drives of perception might be sex, education, experience of the manager. On the other side the information sharing and participation climate within an organization might affect the managerial responses. This claim should cover empirical support. To answer the need the survey of this study is conducted on 612 middle and senior managers of 122 randomly chosen out of top 500 high performing firms operating in different industries in Turkey, between the years of 2012-2014.

Also, increasing the q-gram length will increase efficiency.•Pruning q-gram blocks from the index that contained more than 10% of the total records produced best performance result.•Overall, the proposed approach exhibits better performance as compared to the adaptive detection identity matching technique.Information overload is a growing problem for information management and analytics in many organizations. Identity matching techniques are used to manage and resolve millions of identity records in diverse domains such as health care information, telecom subscribers, insurance holders, law offenders, and the census. In this paper, we propose an identity matching technique that is efficient for large datasets without compromising matching effectiveness. Our experimental results provide strong evidence that our proposed identity matching technique outperforms the adaptive detection identity matching technique in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, reducing the number of required comparisons by almost 98% and the completion time by 97%, with promising scalability results.

One of the challenges of current practices is that these methods rely heavily on traditional data collection and analysis methods such as questionnaires, and face to face or telephone interviews, which have a significant time lag. In this paper we introduce a computational model that combines topic and sentiment classification to elicit influential subjects from consumer perceptions in social media. Our model devises a novel genetic algorithm to improve clustering of tweets in semantically coherent groups, which act as an essential prerequisite when searching for prevailing topics and sentiment in big pools of data. To illustrate the validity of our model, we apply it to the Uber transportation network, from data collected through Twitter for the period between January and April 2015. The results obtained present consumer perceptions and produce insights for two fundamental brand equity dimensions: brand awareness and brand meaning.

36,"Highlights•Affective commitment does not exert a significant positive influence on infusion, whereas normative commitment does;•Continuance commitment depicts a U-shaped effect on infusion;•Sales technology infusion influences both customer oriented selling and sales performance;•Knowledge sharing norms positively moderate the relationship between infusion and customer-oriented selling;•Analytical sales processes negatively moderate the relationship between infusion and customer-oriented selling;Despite increasing interest in sales technology investments, companies continue to struggle with getting their salespeople to use these expensive technologies. In this context, two under-researched issues warrant attention. First, although sales technology represents a continuous source of change, little is known about why salespeople commit to technology-induced changes. Second, knowledge on whether sales force intelligence norms play a role into translating use of sales technology to performance gains is remarkably sparse. To address these gaps, this study develops a conceptual framework that explores the linear and non-linear effects of commitment to technological change (i.e., affective, normative, and continuance) on sales technology infusion, and, in turn, on two key outcomes (i.e., customer-oriented selling and sales performance). Our framework also advances knowledge on how sales force intelligence norms (i.e., analytical sales processes and knowledge sharing with customers) moderate the relationships between sales technology infusion and key outcomes. Analysis is done using multilevel structural equation modeling on a sample of 303 salespeople nested within 22 firms. Findings support the view that the three components of commitment are distinct, with some counter-intuitive results. Specifically, affective commitment does not exert a significant positive influence as expected; yet, normative commitment does. In contrast, while lower levels of continuance commitment reduce infusion, higher levels have positive effects, thus depicting a U-shaped effect. Finally, sales technology infusion influences both key outcomes — and findings support the importance of fostering sales force intelligence norms. Implications of the study are discussed.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2015.03.023,"['Technology infusion', 'Commitment', 'Change', 'Norms', 'Salesperson performance']",Industrial Marketing Management,"Commitment to technological change, sales force intelligence norms, and salesperson key outcomes"
37,"Highlights•This study developed a scale for perceived social media marketing activities (SMMA) of e-commerce.•Employed a blend of qualitative and quantitative research to develop the scale.•The study offers implications of perceived SMMA of e-commerce for academics and managers.The internet has changed the nature of shopping in the past two decades, which has supported the proliferation of e-commerce sites and thus shopping has shifted to e-shopping. Also, customers use social media to gain information on preferred products with the best price options, as social media provides shoppers a voice, and facilitate them to interact and share their opinion worldwide. Moreover, social media is extensively adopted platform for e-commerce. Although, social media marketing has achieved wide acceptance in business, especially in e-commerce, there is no scale in the extant literature to measure perceived social media marketing activities (SMMA) in an e-commerce context. Therefore, this study develops and validates a 15-item, five-dimensional scale for measuring perceived SMMA of e-commerce based on extant literature on e-commerce and social media marketing and five different studies conducted in this research. The scale revealed comprehensive psychometric characteristics as per the results from the diverse reliability and validity checks. It was revealed that perceived SMMA positively influenced purchase intention and brand equity; which endorses the nomological validity of the developed scale. The new scale provides both theoretical as well as managerial implications along with the avenues for forthcoming research.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2017.06.001,"['Social media', 'Social media marketing', 'Scale development', 'e-Commerce', 'e-Shopping']",Telematics and Informatics,Measuring consumer perception of social media marketing activities in e-commerce industry: Scale development & validation
38,":Numerous studies in high-risk work settings reveal the great amount of human related causes in accident and incidents occurrences (e.g., Flin, 2008; Helmreich, 2000; Reason, 1990). Moreover, Endsley (1999) points out that about 88% of all accident causes can be traced back to situation awareness (L1 perception [76.3%], L2 comprehension [20.3%], and L3 anticipation [3.4%]). As there is no common and standardized training content on scanning behavior and situation awareness in today’s flight school education in Switzerland, an effective training concept is necessary a) to support pilots in achieving and maintaining appropriate scanning skills; b) to develop personal mechanisms in handling situation awareness and c) to regain situation awareness after an unexpected event (e.g., LOC-I). The following paper aims at demonstrating a new training design for general aviation pilots. The training involves theoretical information about scanning techniques and situation awareness and is combined with practical exercises - either in a flight simulator or in real flight sessions. During the practical training session, the pilot wears an eye tracking device, which provides the flight instructor (trainer) with immediate information on the pilot’s scanning patterns and state of situation awareness.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.10.463,"['Situation Awareness', 'Scanning Behavior', 'General Aviation', 'Eye Tracking', 'Flight simulator']",IFAC-PapersOnLine,Situation Awareness Training for General Aviation Pilots using Eye Tracking
39,"Highlights•Offering intangibility and trust affect buyer–seller relationship initiation in solution markets.•Intangibility increases the riskiness of the offering, reducing the customer's propensity to engage in a relationship.•Findings suggest a threshold model: sufficient trust in the seller is required to overcome the effects of intangibility.•Offering intangibility and buyer’s trust are also affected by mitigation strategies identified in the study.The importance of collaborative buyer–seller relationships has increased with the transition from product sales to solution provision. However, the extant literature provides only limited evidence on how this transition affects the crucial phase of buyer–seller relationship initiation. This study explores how offer intangibility and the buyer's trust in the seller interact to affect this initiation. Based on a comparative case study of four software solution providers, the findings indicate that the riskiness of an offer, induced by its intangibility, sets a threshold level of trust that needs to be exceeded to cause the buyer to start a relationship with the seller. The data also reveals mitigation strategies that sellers can use to influence the buyer's behavior either by directly reducing the intangibility of the offer or by indirectly enhancing the buyer's trust in the seller.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2014.10.015,"['Buyer–seller relationships', 'Industrial buying', 'Intangibility', 'Interorganizational trust', 'Integrated solutions']",Industrial Marketing Management,"Initiation of buyer–seller relationships: The impact of intangibility, trust and mitigation strategies"

Based on a large-scale survey from employees who use EMA in their workplace across industries, our results suggest that the impact of EMA on perceived job performance and creativity as creativity-supporting systems (in terms of both the habitual use and task-technology fit for EMA) is positive and significant. Our results indicate the positive moderating effect of organizational agility on the relationship between task-technology fit for EMA and perceived job performance. We also identify task-(mobility and feedback) and technology-(reliability, accessibility, and overall quality) characteristics that are found to be positively associated with task-technology fit for EMA. Further, we find that external factors, such as perceived critical mass and the reputation of EMA, can more efficiently explain the habitual use of EMA than internal factors, such as trust and self-efficacy for EMA.

43,"Recently, businesses and research communities have paid a lot of attention to social media and big data. However, the field of supply chain management (SCM) has been relatively slow in studying social media and big data for research and practice. In these contexts, this research contributes to the SCM community by proposing a novel, analytical framework (Twitter Analytics) for analyzing supply chain tweets, highlighting the current use of Twitter in supply chain contexts, and further developing insights into the potential role of Twitter for supply chain practice and research. The proposed framework combines three methodologies – descriptive analytics (DA), content analytics (CA) integrating text mining and sentiment analysis, and network analytics (NA) relying on network visualization and metrics – for extracting intelligence from 22,399 #supplychain tweets. Some of the findings are: supply chain tweets are used by different groups of supply chain professionals and organizations (e.g., news services, IT companies, logistic providers, manufacturers) for information sharing, hiring professionals, and communicating with stakeholders, among others; diverse topics are being discussed, ranging from logistics and corporate social responsibility, to risk, manufacturing, SCM IT and even human rights; some tweets carry strong sentiments about companies׳ delivery services, sales performance, and environmental standards, and risk and disruption in supply chains. Based on these findings, this research presents insights into the use and potential role of Twitter for supply chain practices (e.g., professional networking, stakeholder engagement, demand shaping, new product/service development, supply chain risk management) and the implications for research.

In this study, we adapt the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) to investigate factors predicting consumer behavioral intention (BI) and use behavior (UB) towards mobile shopping apps, considering the impact of two manifestations of consumer's perceived risk: Privacy Risk and Security Risk. Because cultural characteristics may moderate the impact of these risks on behavioral intention and use behavior, we conduct two studies from two consumer panels from countries with significant difference in technology use as captured by the Computer-Based Media Support Index (CMSI), namely India (high CMSI) and USA (low CMSI). For both countries, the baseline UTAUT 2 constructs predict the Behavioral Intention to use mobile shopping apps (and subsequently use behavior). However, the manifestations of perceived risk are significant only for the country with the highest CMSI score, suggesting that cultural influences play a strong role in the adoption of m-shopping. Our study has practical implications for theory as it poses the use of m-shopping apps in a cross-cultural context, suggesting that privacy and security moderate intention to use differently across cultures as predicted by the CMSI. From that perspective, it also has practical implications for consumer behavior researchers and app developers challenged with app localization as well as retailers designing mobile shopping apps for an intercultural audience.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2018.04.017,"['Mobile shopping apps', 'UTAUT2', 'Privacy risk', 'Security risk', 'India', 'USA']",Computers in Human Behavior,Mobile shopping apps adoption and perceived risks: A cross-country perspective utilizing the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology

Receivers were examined as to whether negative messages would influence their perception and actual adoption. This was an experimental study that adopted Starbucks as the research context. 502 valid questionnaires were collected. The data analysis results indicated that both consensus and vividness led to information receivers forming external attributions and perceiving information as credible; receiver brand commitment had a moderating effect on both relationships. Additionally, external attributions about writers had a positive and direct relationship with source credibility but not with information credibility. Source credibility had a positive influence on receiver information credibility but not on negative e-WOM adoption. Based on the results and findings, this study suggested that companies should construct their own communication platform to collect negative consumer comments.

47,"Academic search concerns the retrieval and profiling of information objects in the domain of academic research. In this paper we reveal important observations of academic search queries, and provide an algorithmic solution to address a type of failure during search sessions: null queries. We start by providing a general characterization of academic search queries, by analyzing a large-scale transaction log of a leading academic search engine. Unlike previous small-scale analyses of academic search queries, we find important differences with query characteristics known from web search. E.g., in academic search there is a substantially bigger proportion of entity queries, and a heavier tail in query length distribution. We then focus on search failures and, in particular, on null queries that lead to an empty search engine result page, on null sessions that contain such null queries, and on users who are prone to issue null queries. In academic search approximately 1 in 10 queries is a null query, and 25% of the sessions contain a null query. They appear in different types of search sessions, and prevent users from achieving their search goal. To address the high rate of null queries in academic search, we consider the task of providing query suggestions. Specifically we focus on a highly frequent query type: non-boolean informational queries. To this end we need to overcome query sparsity and make effective use of session information.We find that using entities helps to surface more relevant query suggestions in the face of query sparsity. We also find that query suggestions should be conditioned on the type of session in which they are offered to be more effective. After casting the session classification problem as a multi-label classification problem, we generate session-conditional query suggestions based on predicted session type. We find that this session-conditional method leads to significant improvements over a generic query suggestion method. Personalization yields very little further improvements over session-conditional query suggestions.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2017.01.005,[],Information Processing & Management,Investigating queries and search failures in academic search
48,"Teaching–learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm, which simulates the teaching–learning process of the class room, is one of the recently proposed swarm intelligent (SI) algorithms. The performance of TLBO is maintained by the teaching and learning process, but when the learners cannot found a better position than the old one at some successive iteration, the population might be trapped into local optima. In this paper, an improved teaching–learning-based optimization algorithm with neighborhood search (NSTLBO) is presented. In the proposed method, a ring neighborhood topology is introduced into the original TLBO algorithm to maintain the exploration ability of the population. Different than the traditional method to utilize the global information, the mutation of each learner is now restricted within a certain neighboring area so as to fully utilize the whole space and avoid over-congestion around local optima. Moreover, a mutation operation is presented to NSTLBO during the duplicate eliminations in order to maintain the diversity of population. To verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, thirty-two benchmark functions are utilized. Finally, three application problems of artificial neural network are examined.

The data is being inundated proactively from several sources in various forms; especially social media and in modern data science vocabulary is being recognized as Big Data. Today, Big Data is permeating through the bigger aspect of human life for scientific and commercial dependencies, especially for massive scale data analytics of beyond the exabyte magnitude. As the footprint of Big Data applications is continuously expanding, the reliability on cloud environments is also increasing to obtain appropriate, robust and affordable services to deal with Big Data challenges. Cloud computing avoids any need to locally maintain the overly scaled computing infrastructure that include not only dedicated space, but the expensive hardware and software also. Several data models to process Big Data are already developed and a number of such models are still emerging, potentially relying on heterogeneous underlying storage technologies, including cloud computing. In this paper, we investigate the growing role of cloud computing in Big Data ecosystem. Also, we propose a novel XCLOUDX {XCloudX, X…X}classification to zoom in to gauge the intuitiveness of the scientific name of the cloud-assisted NoSQL Big Data models and analyze whether XCloudX always uses cloud computing underneath or vice versa. XCloudX symbolizes those NoSQL Big Data models that embody the term “cloud” in their name, where X is any alphanumeric variable. The discussion is strengthen by a set of important case studies.

We test the model relationships using data from three different countries, namely, France, Hungary, and the U.K., in an effort to assess the extent to which the development and outcomes of trust are consistent across different countries. The results suggest that supplier performance in product quality and sales service quality is conducive to trust building across all three countries. Supplier performance in technical repair service support enhances trust in the market contexts of France and Hungary, but has no significant effect in the case of the U.K. Nonetheless, supplier performance in complaint handling has a positive effect on trust in the U.K. and French contexts, but no link is established in the context of Hungary. Further, the results show that trust enhances customer loyalty across all countries. Moreover, we find that firm size negatively moderates the trust–loyalty relationship in all the countries, with this link being not significant among larger firms in France and Hungary. The results have important theoretical and practical implications for international relationship marketing.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2017.02.005,"['Trust', 'Supplier performance', 'Customer loyalty', 'Relationship marketing']",Industrial Marketing Management,The role of supplier performance in building customer trust and loyalty: A cross-country examination
51,"Highlights•We analyze the design processes of intelligent systems as undertaken by designers.•We present the five underlying process archetypes.•We propose an improved design process, supporting system designers in their design task.Ubiquitous sensing allows systems to exploit almost any kind of context, and enables the design of intelligent systems that are aware of their context and adapt their behavior accordingly. As such systems have a number of properties, which distinguish them from traditional systems, their design requires a new approach to requirements engineering and to product development. While existing contributions concentrate on individual aspects in the design process, there is a lack of a holistic perspective on the design of intelligent systems. Considering the entire design process, would allow for the creation of better functioning designs, as has been demonstrated in various fields of system design. Furthermore, little is known about how people design intelligent systems. A deep understanding about design practices is, though, a prerequisite for coming up with systematic improvements. The contribution of this paper is twofold: First, based on interviews, we analyze the design processes undertaken by designers, and present five underlying process archetypes. We focus on how designers identify, select, and consider context across the entire design process. Second, we propose an improved design process for intelligent systems that aims at supporting system designers in their design task in order to serve an organization's, and/or users’ needs.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2015.10.041,"['System design', 'Design process', 'Context selection']",Journal of Systems and Software,Considering context in the design of intelligent systems: Current practices and suggestions for improvement

54,"Customer referral reward programs have recently gained popularity as beneficial customer acquisition tools. This research aims to explore the impact of reward type, specifically with regard to the differential effects of monetary versus in-kind rewards, on referral success. We find that although consumers prefer monetary rewards to in-kind rewards because of the greater economic value of monetary rewards, the higher social costs associated with money offset this benefit and even render money an inferior incentive when the recommendation is not well justified. Through four experiments, we demonstrate that monetary rewards (vs. in-kind rewards) lead to less referral generation and acceptance, especially when the recommended brands are weak (Studies 1 and 4), and that perceived social costs mediate the interactive effect of reward type and brand strength (Studies 1 and 3). Moreover, by increasing the economic benefit or decreasing the social costs associated with monetary rewards, we restore the effectiveness of monetary rewards as incentives. Compared with in-kind rewards, monetary rewards perform equally well when the reward is sufficiently large (Study 2), and they perform even better when both the recommender and the receiver are rewarded (Study 3). This research extends the literature on the psychological consequences of money and provides novel insights into the customer referral process.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijresmar.2013.08.005,"['Referral reward program', 'Customer acquisition', 'Monetary reward', 'In-kind reward', 'Psychological cost']",International Journal of Research in Marketing,When giving money does not work: The differential effects of monetary versus in-kind rewards in referral reward programs
55,"Highlights•We present a big data analytics capability (BDAC) model.•We frame BDAC on firm performance (FPER) using the RBV and the entanglement view of sociomaterialism.•We confirm the impact of BDAC on FPER and the role of business strategy alignment.The recent interest in big data has led many companies to develop big data analytics capability (BDAC) in order to enhance firm performance (FPER). However, BDAC pays off for some companies but not for others. It appears that very few have achieved a big impact through big data. To address this challenge, this study proposes a BDAC model drawing on the resource-based theory (RBT) and the entanglement view of sociomaterialism. The findings show BDAC as a hierarchical model, which consists of three primary dimensions (i.e., management, technology, and talent capability) and 11 subdimensions (i.e., planning, investment, coordination, control, connectivity, compatibility, modularity, technology management knowledge, technical knowledge, business knowledge and relational knowledge). The findings from two Delphi studies and 152 online surveys of business analysts in the U.S. confirm the value of the entanglement conceptualization of the higher-order BDAC model and its impact on FPER. The results also illuminate the significant moderating impact of analytics capability–business strategy alignment on the BDAC–FPER relationship.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2016.08.018,"['Capabilities', 'Entanglement view', 'Big data analytics', 'Hierarchical modeling']",International Journal of Production Economics,How to improve firm performance using big data analytics capability and business strategy alignment?

This scenario of mutual dependence entails a flow of power among companies. Power is an intrinsic property of their relationship and an asset to be exercised with a degree of intentionality. This paper presents a substantive theory to explain how power and dependence manifest in partnerships among small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) building a software ecosystem. We performed exploratory case studies of two emerging software ecosystems formed by SMEs. We interpreted the results in light of a theoretical framework underpinned by French and Raven's power taxonomy. Finally, we performed a cross-case analysis to evaluate our findings and build the theory. The proposed theory highlights the interactions among different forms of power and corresponding sources of power employed by companies. It provides a better understanding on how power and dependence influence the behaviour and coordination of companies within a software ecosystem. The theory is a useful lens for researchers to explore ecosystem partnerships by understanding the structure and impact of power relationships between partners. In addition, it is a valuable tool for companies to analyse power distribution and define sustainable strategies for software ecosystem governance.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2017.08.044,"['Software ecosystem', 'Small-to-medium enterprises', 'Power', 'Dependence', 'Multiple case studies']",Journal of Systems and Software,A theory of power in emerging software ecosystems formed by small-to-medium enterprises
58,"Conflicts are an inherent part of organizational life and managers deal with confrontations and conflicts on an almost daily basis. EIS implementations are a type of change that often leads to open or hidden conflicts. Managers and others involved can only deal with such conflicts effectively if they understand the nature and causes of enterprise information system conflicts (EIS conflicts). To contribute to such an understanding, this study focuses on the analysis of EIS conflicts. In so doing, it aims to identify various types of IS conflicts and to develop a framework that can be helpful in assessing these conflicts. To this end, we have conducted a meta-ethnographic study – that is, we synthesized earlier case studies in which EIS conflicts are described. We purposefully selected eleven qualitative descriptions of EIS conflicts and we analyzed the topics, contexts, and processes of these conflicts. Based on this analysis, we propose a two-dimensional framework of EIS conflicts that leads to a categorization involving four EIS conflict types: task, implementation process, structure, and value conflicts. Based on the conflicts that were studied, this paper also reveals that, in reality, many EIS conflicts have a hybrid form and develop from one type to another over time.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.protcy.2014.10.070,"['EIS implementation', 'Conflict', 'Conflict types', 'Resistance', 'Meta-ethnography']",Procedia Technology,Towards a Framework of Enterprise Information System Conflicts
59,"Highlights•This study proves the value of telematics-based data in the risk selection process of an insurance company•It compares the performance of three models in this context: a logistic regression, random forests and artificial neural networks model•This research illustrates the importance of industry knowledge in the variable creation process•Three months of data is sufficient to obtain the best risk estimationsThe advent of the Internet of Things enables companies to collect an increasing amount of sensor generated data which creates plenty of new business opportunities. This study investigates how this sensor data can improve the risk selection process in an insurance company. More specifically, several risk assessment models based on three different data mining techniques are augmented with driving behaviour data collected from In-Vehicle Data Recorders. This study proves that including standard telematics variables significantly improves the risk assessment of customers. As a result, insurers will be better able to tailor their products to the customers' risk profile. Moreover, this research illustrates the importance of including industry knowledge, combined with data expertise, in the variable creation process. Especially when a regulator forces the use of easily interpretable data mining techniques, expert-based telematics variables are able to improve the risk assessment model in addition to the standard telematics variables. Further, the results suggest that if a manager wants to implement Usage-Based-Insurances, Pay-As-You-Drive related variables are most valuable to tailor the premium to the risk. Finally, the study illustrates that this new type of telematics-based insurance product can quickly be implemented since three months of data is already sufficient to obtain the best risk estimations.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2017.04.009,"['Internet of things', 'Usage-based-insurance', 'Risk assessment model', 'Logistic regression', 'Random forests', 'Artificial neural networks']",Decision Support Systems,The value of vehicle telematics data in insurance risk selection processes

61,"The assessment of shelter needs of displaced people in the aftermath of major earthquake events is one the main challenges that emergency responders currently have to face. Based on the scale of the disaster, the short-term shelter demand can turn into a temporary housing need for displaced population, which is a local government responsibility. The study presented in this paper is focused on a critical review of currently available methodologies and corresponding software packages that were developed specifically for estimating the number of displaced people and those who will most likely seek public sheltering and will need temporary housing. The main features and shortcomings of such tools are highlighted and interpreted with a view to future improvement and application in the disaster management field. Two software tools, ERGO-EQ and HAZUS-MH, have been identified as more exhaustive in considering all the different variables involved in the shelter needs estimation. For this reason, this study also includes a full application of those two software tools to a real case study. Specifically, the modelling of the February 22nd, 2011 Christchurch earthquake is presented, in which hazard, vulnerability and exposure (both physical and social) were characterized over a specific area of Christchurch urban area as input to the aforementioned software tools. The employed tools yielded different results in terms of dislocated people and shelter needs estimates, for which a brief discussion is presented on possible ways to improve and to better reflect the local conditions, in order to produce more realistic outputs.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2016.11.010,"['Seismic risk', 'Short-term shelter needs', 'Predictive models', 'Temporary housing software tools', '22nd February 2011 Christchurch earthquake']",International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,Predictive models for post disaster shelter needs assessment

Estimates suggest that the market for GES was around US$930 billion in 2012, rising to US$1.4 trillion by 2020 (ISG, 2013). Yet this influential sector receives scant attention in the operations management literature. The paper draws on six case studies to explore the operations management challenges of delivering GES. In doing so the paper introduces the concept of network capabilities for GES, highlighting the centrality that: (i) network resources – accessing and deploying dispersed resources, (ii) network coordination – coordinating and integrating network activities, and (iii) network learning – collective learning and knowledge management, all play in enabling the successful operational management of GES.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jom.2016.03.006,"['Global engineering services (GES)', 'Network capabilities', 'Professional service operations management (PSOM)']",Journal of Operations Management,Global engineering services: Shedding light on network capabilities

Applying state-of-the-art social analytics methodology to analyze the sentiments embedded in these consumer comments facilitates both firms' product design strategies and individual consumers' comparison shopping. However, existing social analytics methods often adopt coarse-grained and context-free sentiment analysis approaches. Consequently, these methods may not be effective enough to support firms and consumers' demands of fine-grained extraction of market intelligence from social media. Guided by the design science research methodology, the main contribution of our research is the design of a novel social analytics methodology that can leverage the sheer volume of consumer reviews archived at social media sites to perform a fine-grained extraction of market intelligence. More specifically, the proposed social analytics methodology is underpinned by a novel semi-supervised fuzzy product ontology mining algorithm. Evaluated based on real-world social media data, our prototype system shows remarkable performance improvement over a baseline ontology learning system and a context-free sentiment analysis system.

73,"Highlights•We compare the impact of multiple touchpoints on consideration in four categories.•Respondents report on six touchpoints using the real-time experience tracking method.•Touchpoint positivity and not just touchpoint frequency influences consideration.•In-store communications positivity is more influential than that of ads, WOM or PR.•Peer observation, a hardly studied touchpoint, is both pervasive and persuasive.Marketers face the challenge of resource allocation across a range of touchpoints. Hence understanding their relative impact is important, but previous research tends to examine brand advertising, retailer touchpoints, word-of-mouth, and traditional earned touchpoints separately. This article presents an approach to understanding the relative impact of multiple touchpoints. It exemplifies this approach with six touchpoint types: brand advertising, retailer advertising, in-store communications, word-of-mouth, peer observation (seeing other customers), and traditional earned media such as editorial. Using the real-time experience tracking (RET) method by which respondents report on touchpoints by contemporaneous text message, the impact of touchpoints on change in brand consideration is studied in four consumer categories: electrical goods, technology products, mobile handsets, and soft drinks. Both touchpoint frequency and touchpoint positivity, the valence of the customer's affective response to the touchpoint, are modeled. While relative touchpoint effects vary somewhat by category, a pooled model suggests the positivity of in-store communication is in general more influential than that of other touchpoints including brand advertising. An almost entirely neglected touchpoint, peer observation, is consistently significant. Overall, findings evidence the relative impact of retailers, social effects and third party endorsement in addition to brand advertising. Touchpoint positivity adds explanatory power to the prediction of change in consideration as compared with touchpoint frequency alone. This suggests the importance of methods that track touchpoint perceptual response as well as frequency, to complement current analytic approaches such as media mix modeling based on media spend or exposure alone.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jretai.2014.12.008,"['Retailing', 'Advertising', 'Integrated marketing communications', 'In-store communications', 'Word-of-mouth (WOM)']",Journal of Retailing,The Impact of Different Touchpoints on Brand Consideration

Partial least squares analysis results suggest that confirmation of expectation, search effort, and alternative attractiveness are predictors of regret, which in turn influences satisfaction and repurchase intention; confirmation of expectation and search effort also exhibited considerable positive effects on satisfaction, which in turn influenced repurchase intention. In addition, prior loyalty negatively moderates the relationship between satisfaction and repurchase intention.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.im.2016.12.005,"['Expectancy confirmation theory', 'Regret', 'Alternative attractiveness', 'Information search', 'Repurchase intention', 'Satisfaction']",Information & Management,Factors influencing online shoppers’ repurchase intentions: The roles of satisfaction and regret
77,"Highlights•We assess the added value of leading and lagging information in sentiment analysis.•We analyze 17,697 Facebook status updates.•We use two classification algorithms, five times twofold cross-validation and the Friedman test.•Including leading and lagging data increases the AUC substantially.•These findings clearly indicate that including leading and lagging data is a viable strategy.The purpose of this study is to (1) assess the added value of information available before (i.e., leading) and after (i.e., lagging) the focal post's creation time in sentiment analysis of Facebook posts, (2) determine which predictors are most important, and (3) investigate the relationship between top predictors and sentiment. We build a sentiment prediction model, including leading information, lagging information, and traditional post variables. We benchmark Random Forest and Support Vector Machines using five times twofold cross-validation. The results indicate that both leading and lagging information increase the model's predictive performance. The most important predictors include the number of uppercase letters, the number of likes and the number of negative comments. A higher number of uppercase letters and likes increases the likelihood of a positive post, while a higher number of comments increases the likelihood of a negative post. The main contribution of this study is that it is the first to assess the added value of leading and lagging information in the context of sentiment analysis.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2016.06.013,"['Facebook', 'Text mining', 'Sentiment analysis', 'Machine learning', 'Social media']",Decision Support Systems,The added value of auxiliary data in sentiment analysis of Facebook posts

79,"Online consumer reviews offer an unprecedented amount of information for consumers to evaluate services before purchase. We use the dual process theory to investigate consumer perceptions about information helpfulness (IH) in electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) contexts. Results highlight that popularity signals, two-sided reviews, and expert sources (but not source trustworthiness) are perceived as helpful by consumers to assess service quality and performance. Although two-sided reviews exercise a significant influence on perceived IH, their influence on purchase intention was indirectly mediated by IH. IH predicts purchase intention and partially mediates the relationship between popularity signals, source homophily, source expertise, and purchase intention.",2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.im.2018.04.010,"['Electronic word of mouth', 'Services', 'Dual process theory', 'Perceived information helpfulness', 'Purchase intention']",Information & Management,Consumer perceptions of information helpfulness and determinants of purchase intention in online consumer reviews of services
80,"Co-creation is described as a resource integration process involving actors that are linked within a service ecosystem. This process occurs when value propositions attract actors to share their resources during collaborative activities and interactions, termed co-creation practices. The purpose of this paper is three-fold: (1) to develop a typology of co-creation practices that shape a dynamic health care service ecosystem, identifying those practices that have positive effects, those that have negative effects, and those that can have either positive or negative effects on the service ecosystem; (2) to provide indicative measures of co-creation practices; and (3) to offer a compelling research agenda. Actors assess their resources and seek to address resource gaps, engaging in co-creation practices that offer access to valued resources. As such, we argue that co-creation practices play a central role in shaping the service ecosystem, influencing which resources are available, when they are employed, and how they are integrated. We develop a typology consisting of eight co-creation practices, illustrating these in the context of a health care ecosystem. We provide a set of indicative measures, identifying how co-creation practices can impact the well-being of the ecosystem, and develop a research agenda calling for further studies in this important area.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2016.03.007,"['Co-creation practices', 'Resource integration', 'Value co-creation', 'Ecosystem', 'Health care']",Industrial Marketing Management,Co-creation practices: Their role in shaping a health care ecosystem
81,"Highlights•This study applies the ISS and TAM to investigate user intention to continue using WBSS.•This study applies the questionnaire method and PLS to collect and analyze primary data.•Specific recommendations are provided for enterprises to enhance the intention to continue using WBSS.The popularization of Internet and the development of cloud computing have not only changed our lifestyles, but have impacted the ways in which enterprises relate with their customers. For example, customers and enterprises can now directly interact through web-based self-services (e.g., Internet banking, online ticketing, online bookstores, and online reservations) that do not require face-to-face interactions. Web-based self-services (WBSS) allow enterprises to proactively initiate contacts with customers and respond to their needs. Customers can also quickly access the services they want online, at any time and place, thus enhancing overall service efficiency. However, a review of the previous literature shows that most related studies have used the Technology Acceptance Model, which examines perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and attitude toward use, in order to investigate user behaviors when operating a WBSS. In contrast, there are few studies that examine the impact of perceived usefulness and perceived quality features on the continued intention to use a WBSS. Therefore, this study applied the questionnaire method and investigated the relationships among users’ perceived usage characteristics, quality characteristics, satisfaction and continued usage intention with regard to WBSS. Based on the results, specific recommendations are provided for enterprises to enhance the intention to continue using WBSS.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jretconser.2015.02.001,"['Web-based self-service', 'Continued usage intention', 'Satisfaction', 'Information system success model', 'Technology acceptance model']",Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,Exploring the intention to continue using web-based self-service
82,"The present paper introduces and reviews existing technology and research works in the field of e-Procurement. More specifically this survey aims to collect those relevant approaches that have tackled the challenge of delivering more advanced and intelligent e-Procurement management systems due to its relevance in the industry to afford more timely, adaptable and flexible decisions in purchasing processes. Although existing tools and techniques have demonstrated their ability to manage e-Procurement processes as a part of a supply management system there is a lack of interoperability among tools, tangled dependencies between processes or difficulties to exploit existing data and information to name a few that are preventing a proper use of the new dynamic and data-based environment. On the other hand semantic-based technologies emerge to provide the adequate building blocks to represent domain-knowledge and elevate the meaning of information resources through a common and shared data model (RDF) with a formal query language (SPARQL) and accessible via the Internet Protocols. In this sense the Linked Data effort has gained momentum to apply the principles of the aforementioned initiative to boost the re-use of information and data across different tools and processes. That is why authors review both existing open issues in the context e-Procurement with special focus on public procurement and semantic-based approaches to address them. To do so a preliminary research study is conducted to assess the state of the art in the context of e-Procurement and semantic-based systems. Afterwards main drawbacks of existing e-Procurement systems are presented to narrow down in semantic-based approaches applied to this field. Once the current status in both areas is reviewed, authors purpose the use and creation of an e-Procurement index to evaluate the quality of service of procurement systems. In this light the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is used to set up an initial weight for each indicator in the index and to perform a first comparison between traditional and semantic-based approaches. Finally some discussion, conclusions and future challenges are also outlined.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2014.04.005,"['e-Procurement', 'Semantics', 'Interoperability', 'Supply chain', 'Public procurement']",Computers in Industry,New trends on e-Procurement applying semantic technologies: Current status and future challenges
83,"Highlights•The adoption of Augmented Reality (AR) technologies in retailing is investigated.•Two AR interaction approaches – markerless and marker-based – are compared.•Measurement is performed with a direct and an indirect approach.•Four experiments with a total of 978 participants are used for hypothesis testing.•Findings reflect similarities and dissimilarities of the approaches.Increasingly, retailers rely on interactive technologies to improve consumers' shopping experiences. On the one side, interactive kiosks and smart mirrors make use of dedicated devices and software to explain, configure, and recommend products. On the other side, computer programs – so-called apps – are installed on the consumer's own device for the same purpose. They can be used at home, or – if installed on a mobile device – in retail outlets or on the move. In all cases, augmented reality (AR) can support these purposes by placing virtual content (e.g. new furniture) in a real environment (the consumer's home). The overall perception and acceptance toward such interactive technologies are discussed in this paper. Users' perceptions and experiences are measured by applying a modified technology acceptance model (TAM). Four experiments, two with marker-based and two with markerless AR apps are presented to support the generalization of the results, the measurement models and the measurement approach. The results are satisfactory with regard to the robustness of the TAM model. However, the relative importance of hedonic (enjoyment, pleasure, fun) and utilitarian (information) aspects varies for different kinds of AR apps and has to be considered for improvement to occur. From a measurement point of view the acquiescence bias has to be dealt with when developing scale items.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2016.10.010,"['Augmented reality (AR)', 'Scan function', 'Virtual mirror', 'E-commerce', 'Technology acceptance model (TAM)', 'Markerless', 'Marker-based']",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,How augmented reality apps are accepted by consumers: A comparative analysis using scales and opinions

Thus, project proponents should not only try to attract more visitors but also understand their funding intention, which is particularly important in increasing the success of fundraising projects. Based on social exchange theory, this study examines the key factors influencing backers’ funding intention. More than 204 experienced backers in Taiwan participated in this study, and structural equation modeling was applied for data analysis. Results show that commitment has a remarkable and positive effect on funding intention. Interestingly, perceived risk was found to be positively associated with funding intention, which challenges the conventional view of perceived risk having a negative effect on usage intention. The moderating effects of regulatory focus and funding amount are also discussed. This study not only indicates the key determinates of backers’ funding intention for management but also explains the potential significance of positive perceived risk in funding intention to the literature.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2016.06.006,"['Crowdfunding', 'Funding intention', 'Commitment', 'Social exchange theory', 'Regulatory focus']",Telematics and Informatics,Determinants of backers’ funding intention in crowdfunding: Social exchange theory and regulatory focus

We develop an agent-based simulation model of conflicts in firm-hosted online communities and find that a collaborating conflict management style characterized by high levels of cooperativeness and assertiveness helps to successfully handle conflict. However, the effectiveness of this collaborative style is highly dependent on contingency factors related to the participating individuals and the social structure within the community itself, such as the number of moderators and aggressors present in the community, their credibility, as well as the overall opinion of the community. Depending on these factors, collaborating and accommodating conflict management becomes more or less successful. Under some configurations it is even less effective than more competitive and assertive management styles. Therefore, to successfully handle conflict and restrain the escalation of a firestorm, organizations need to optimally adapt their conflict management style to varying conditions by considering individual-level and community-level characteristics.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsis.2017.01.002,"['Online communities', 'Social conflict', 'Conflict management', 'Agent-based simulation']",The Journal of Strategic Information Systems,Firestorms: Modeling conflict diffusion and management strategies in online communities
87,"Open government is a new phenomenon that attracted much research in recent years. The major dimensions of open government included some redundancy with respect to the indications of these concepts. Through an extensive literature review, this study tried to breakdown the three major pillars of open government into their known sub-dimensions. The second step was to summarize the basic concepts reported in the literature and map them to these dimensions. Finally, this work tried to synthesize the basic concepts into four major dimensions. The proposed dimensions are: transparency, information accountability, collaboration and empowerment.The second objective of this work is to validate this proposed model by utilizing an empirical test using confirmatory factor analysis. The research model proposed tried to predict Jordanians' intentions to use e-government services using the four proposed dimensions of open government. Empirical results supported our premise and indicated a good fit of dimensions and acceptable loadings on each dimension. Also, the regression test predicted the intention to use e-government websites with an acceptable coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.409). Empirical results indicated a significant prediction of intention to use e-government website by all dimensions proposed with more weight for information accountability.

88,"Highlights•We explore the determinants of online knowledge adoption with respect to informational and normative social influences.•Knowledge quality and source credibility positively affect knowledge adoption.•Knowledge consensus and knowledge rating positively affect knowledge adoption.•Time pressure moderates the relationships between knowledge adoption and four determinants of knowledge adoption.This study aims to explore the determinants of online knowledge adoption with respect to informational and normative social influences. Existing studies on online knowledge adoption have primarily focused on the perspective of knowledge provider. Knowledge recipients, however, also play a fundamental role in knowledge adoption. Informational and normative social influence theory is utilized as the theoretical foundation to investigate the influences of informational and normative factors on online knowledge adoption. Based on the theories and previous literature, this study proposes a theoretical model of knowledge adoption, in which knowledge quality and source credibility serve as informational determinants, whereas knowledge consensus and knowledge rating serve as normative determinants. In addition, time pressure is hypothesized to be a moderator that impacts the dual evaluation process toward knowledge adoption. Data collected from 510 respondents was tested against the research model using the partial least squares approach. The findings demonstrate that both informational and normative determinants had positive effects on knowledge adoption, while the moderating test indicates that time pressure exerted influences with different directions on the two evaluation processes of adopting behavior.

Consistent with the theory that distinct holistic cultures predict tipping and non-tipping behaviors, the findings identify configurations of cultural attributes (e.g. “masculine benevolence”, “feminine benevolence”, and “achieving individualist”) in combination with national religiosity and economic well-being that account for the majority of nations with high prevalence of tipping—as well as configurations (e.g. “collective individualist”) that account for nations with low prevalence of tipping. These configurations provide tourism operators, regulators, service providers and tourists with insight about the drivers of tipping expectations at the national level and therefore enable better management of the tourism experience. The paper also demonstrates the usefulness of a complexity theory approach to explore complex phenomena by revealing holistic configurations of antecedent conditions; identifying multiple configurations that explain the same outcome; demonstrating that configurations for high and low prevalence are asymmetric, and; demonstrating that antecedent conditions operate in opposite ways depending on other ingredients in a configuration.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2017.05.001,"['Asymmetric testing', 'Configural analysis', 'Complexity theory', 'Culture', 'Fuzzy-set', 'Tipping']",Tourism Management,"Culture, religiosity, and economic configural models explaining tipping-behavior prevalence across nations"
90,"Highlights•Process prioritization based on process log data•Process prioritization based on structural and stochastic dependencies•Process prioritization based on predicted process performanceBusiness process management (BPM) is an essential paradigm of organizational design and a source of corporate performance. The most value-creating activity of BPM is process improvement. With effective process prioritization being a critical success factor for process improvement, we propose the Data-Driven Process Prioritization (D2P2) approach. By addressing the weaknesses of extant process prioritization approaches, the D2P2 accounts for structural and stochastic process dependencies and leverages log data. The D2P2 returns a priority list that indicates in which future periods the processes from a process network should undergo the next in-depth analysis to check whether they actually require improvement. The D2P2 contributes to the prescriptive knowledge on process prioritization and process decision-making. As for evaluation, we discussed the D2P2's design specification against theory-backed design objectives and competing artefacts. We also instantiated the D2P2 as a software prototype and applied the prototype to a real-world scenario based on the 2012 BPI Challenge log.",2017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2017.02.011,"['Business Process Management', 'Process Prioritization', 'Process Improvement', 'Business Process Architecture', 'Process Logs']",Decision Support Systems,Data-driven Process Prioritization in Process Networks

94,"•Using data quality metadata for decision making.•Impact of data quality metadata on decision outcomes.•Empirical study on data quality metadata.Decision making processes and their outcomes can be affected by a number of factors. Among them, the quality of the data is critical. Poor quality data cause poor decisions. Although this fact is widely known, data quality (DQ) is still a critical issue in organizations because of the huge data volumes available in their systems. Therefore, literature suggests that communicating the DQ level of a specific data set to decision makers in the form of DQ metadata (DQM) is essential. However, the presence of DQM may overload or demand cognitive resources beyond decision makers' capacities, which can adversely impact the decision outcomes. To address this issue, we have conducted an experiment to explore the impact of DQM on decision outcomes, to identify different groups of decision makers who benefit from DQM and to explore different factors which enhance or otherwise hinder the use of DQM. Findings of a statistical analysis suggest that the use of DQM can be enhanced by data quality training or education. Decision makers with a certain level of data quality awareness used DQM more to solve a decision task than those with no data quality awareness. Moreover, those with data quality awareness reached a higher decision accuracy. However, the efficiency of decision makers suffers when DQM is used. Our suggestion would be that DQM can have a positive impact on decision outcomes if it is associated with some characteristics of decision makers, such as a high data quality knowledge. However, the results do not confirm that DQM should be included in data warehouses as a general business practice, instead organizations should first investigate the use and impact of DQM in their setting before maintaining DQM in data warehouses.",2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2015.12.006,"['Data quality', 'Decision strategy', 'Decision support systems', 'Data quality metadata (DQM)']",Decision Support Systems,Determining the use of data quality metadata (DQM) for decision making purposes and its impact on decision outcomes — An exploratory study
95,"Highlights•Outside-in marketing capability positively affects firm performance.•Outside-in marketing capability directs flexible resource allocation for performance.•Outside-in marketing capability can be (counter) productive to performance.Employing an outside-in strategic perspective, we address an under-researched question in the extant marketing literature: How and when do firms, by virtue of their outside-in marketing capability, manage to achieve superior performance? We find that outside-in marketing capability leads to superior firm performance via its impact on inside-out marketing capability and strategic flexibility. Outside-in marketing capability provides a basis for the firm to update its inside-out marketing capability and to flexibly allocate resources leading to a performance advantage. Our results suggest that modeling outside-in marketing capability along with inside-out marketing capability and strategic flexibility provides a more accurate picture of firm performance outcomes and enhances the efficacy of marketing capability logic with respect to firm performance. We also show that outside-in marketing capability positively affects firm performance only when transformational leadership and employee proactivity are relatively high. When transformational leadership and employee proactivity are low respectively, increasing outside-in marketing capability can have counter-productive impact on firm performance. This interaction between outside-in marketing capability and human capital shows that both factors work together to achieve superior firm performance. The results suggest that firms stand to gain more from outside-in marketing capability by devoting resources to developing leadership skills and nurturing employee proactivity.

96,"Highlights•We argue that comprehensibility is crucial in software effort and fault prediction.•We extracted new datasets based on the Android repository.•ALPA extracts a tree that mimics the performance of the complex model.•The extracted trees are not only comprehensible but also more accurate.Software fault and effort prediction are important tasks to minimize costs of a software project. In software effort prediction the aim is to forecast the effort needed to complete a software project, whereas software fault prediction tries to identify fault-prone modules. In this research both tasks are considered, thereby using different data mining techniques. The predictive models not only need to be accurate but also comprehensible, demanding that the user can understand the motivation behind the model's prediction. Unfortunately, to obtain predictive performance, comprehensibility is often sacrificed and vice versa. To overcome this problem, we extract trees from well performing Random Forests (RFs) and Support Vector Machines for regression (SVRs) making use of a rule extraction algorithm ALPA. This method builds trees (using C4.5 and REPTree) that mimic the black-box model (RF, SVR) as closely as possible. The proposed methodology is applied to publicly available datasets, complemented with new datasets that we have put together based on the Android repository. Surprisingly, the trees extracted from the black-box models by ALPA are not only comprehensible and explain how the black-box model makes (most of) its predictions, but are also more accurate than the trees obtained by working directly on the data.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2014.10.032,"['Rule extraction', 'Software fault and effort prediction', 'Comprehensibility']",Journal of Systems and Software,Comprehensible software fault and effort prediction: A data mining approach
